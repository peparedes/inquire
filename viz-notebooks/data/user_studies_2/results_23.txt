0.741 -- i think i want to use it as a personal outlet instead of a social activity or something . 
0.741 -- i joined a website , , which is like a self help meets social networking site , or like i usually call it , a facebook for problematic cases .

0.741 -- i recently read a article about how technology such as email , facebook and twitter is ruining the social and interpersonal skills of gen y ers and i am starting to agree . 
0.741 -- this is the second time i am making use of the work s social club s corporate discounts and have to say i really enjoy their ideas for new social experiences for the employees . 
0.741 -- social networking sites , such as facebook , twitter , livejournal , etc , encourage people to connect with others . 
0.741 -- yet , social networking sites like facebook , myspace and others leave me cold because they lack the blogging power of livejournal .

0.741 -- i m here at the music school right now , because we decided not to get internet in our apartment , it makes us a lot more productive seeing as i get addicted to internet fads such as aim , facebook , myspace , livejournal ... and various random websites ... i think i can handle the lack of internet . 
0.740 -- i ve been a somewhat passive user of the internet throughout my life ... due in part to the fact that i am still using dial up internet and also in part to the way i was raised to inherently distrust the internet .

0.740 -- com , shopping ebay , games , weblogs social interaction facebook etc , webchat during working hours just how am i supposed to sort out my social life without checking in on facebook and lj during my coffee breaks ? 
0.740 -- anyway , this just an observation i have made on various social networking sites . 
0.740 -- i ve been making an effort to keep up with various social networking websites . 
0.740 -- so i spent an entire year of college crusading against all things involving internet journals and social groups . 
0.740 -- i have a life outside of myspace , chevelle , xanga , the internet etc . 
0.739 -- so , i had a presentation this morning on virtual reference , chat and im and social networking software , ie : flicker , blogs , facebook , myspace , wikis , etc .

0.739 -- nowadays , apart from blogging , i see no life in using the internet .

0.739 -- i also hate being social , i hate wanting to have a social life . 
0.739 -- i m all sorts of anti social lately ... but the most social anyone can be .

0.739 -- npr s talk of the nation is discussing social networking online ie myspace , livejournal , and facebook . 
0.739 -- yay for being social i am actually out of the house and beign social ... hence why im on the computer &lt; . 
0.739 -- partly because i am trying to critique the whole world of literary criticism , which i don t know anything at all about ... liberatory and utopian approaches to computer mediated social life assume that proliferation of computer use in our lives is unambiguously , irrespective of specific usage patterns , or the level of engagement of users . 
0.739 -- all the forums i visit entertainment , my web site uncategorized , and even the legitimate sites i use for research .

0.738 -- com that political activist bloggers in iran spur on social reform , giving that the internet is one of the few places were a simblance of free speach may be reached barring recent increased internet restrictions from the iranian government , which made me consider my own recent lj and lead me to the decision to exercise my freedom of speach through miss spelled words and bad syntax in this , my blog . 
0.738 -- the internet s myriad social websites are amusing , yes , but the noises humans make are social things for personal interactions and your computer is not a social thing or a real personal interaction .

0.734 -- the use of new media , social networking , graphics , communication and the internet were outstanding . 
0.734 -- i decided on social work because i can go into anything and social workers are always in demand . 
0.734 -- with the recent proliferation of facebook , twitter , and real blogs , i simply cannot see what void livejournal fills in the universe of the internet . 
0.734 -- the reason was simple : unlike the other big players of the time mdash ; friendster , livejournal , and myspace mdash ; tribe had the best many to many social interaction i d seen on any of the general purpose social networking sites . 
0.734 -- i never realized before how much i use the internet for communication and information gathering . 
0.734 -- yes , using the internet to spread news and information and coordinate low level campaign volunteers increases one s reach and the opportunity for personal involvement : citizen driven political activism limited to local and regional scopes can reach into any home with internet access .

0.733 -- it s another of these social networking sites like myspace , bebo etc etc . 
0.733 -- as i intend to , at least , a continue , and expand on , my political social activism , and b develop graphics and publication production businesses , i ll need access to cable or some other high speed internet , although a phone line for a dial up modem would at least put me back on the net .

0.733 -- anyway , she found the countercurse for the spell that bans computer usage , and even the internet , and well now i m learning about the internet . 
0.733 -- i was confronting social injustice as i had in the women s and anti imperialist movements , but i was able to use my almost daily experience of people trying to manhandle me onto trains or across streets simply because i m blind as the basis of my expertise and energy in advocating for that social change . 
0.733 -- i m fascinated this because i ve been playing around with facebook , and myspace , and twitter , and the other five million forms of social networking . 
0.732 -- found a new internet addiction so i guess devloping a social life now is out of the question . 
0.732 -- so ... i m without home internet access right now and i ve been using the internet at school and the library .

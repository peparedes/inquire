0.803 -- my house that i lived in for most of my life , my friends , and my memories ! 
0.803 -- its wonderfully nostalgic for me , and maybe some compliments or memories will surface for my friends . 
0.803 -- it brings back fond memories , memories of joyous moments which i have been privileged enough to experience and never forget till i breathe : the joys of welcoming my kid brother into this world , the pride my parents felt for i was their son , the poetry debate programming contests i triumphed , the unrestrained pride at landing my first job before i turned , the moments i do not write about here . 
0.803 -- i have to say i did enjoy my years at verot despite some hardships i ve made some memories with the people i love that will last me a lifetime .

0.803 -- making memories with the people i love ... and making memories that last a lifetime . 
0.803 -- memories that i didnt need to have back in my mind ... i actually saw ghosts today . 
0.803 -- but maybe i m just living through my memories , and the letters i get from my family . 
0.803 -- for my own sanity , i ve not been living off memories in the past . 
0.803 -- i tend to like to keep memories in my mind , and share things about myself with the people in my life through conversations .

0.802 -- i guess i still remember all of this , even if my memories of shiyue have returned .

0.802 -- i am very fond of the memories made from the past couple of days . 
0.802 -- i could write about my past , but i ve been trying to avoid most of my memories of late .

0.801 -- as i listen to this music , my memories begin to form into tears liquid of my past . 
0.801 -- that is , until i am reminded of a particular memory and my brain starts connecting pieces from other memories , and other memories , and other memories , etc . 
0.801 -- i have had great memories in the past ... but memories do not build hope for me . 
0.801 -- i ve ditched my memories before so i know from experience that when you ditch your memories , things tend to stick around anyway . 
0.801 -- i have all kinds of great memories of time spent with her to celebrate . 
0.801 -- it ll probably always be one of my favorite lifetime memories i cherish into old age .

0.801 -- for the past two or maybe three days , my dreams have been vivid and important , but have become foggy by morning , and i can t differentiate my memories of the day from my memories of the night . 
0.801 -- i forget my joys and happy moments and cherish the pains that i ve gone through in my life .

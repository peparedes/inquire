0.732 -- loneliness drags what is left of my fragile mind and my innocence into the bloody oblivion of the beast . 
0.732 -- what occupies me most is thoughts of my old lover and thoughts of the girl i met while home . 
0.732 -- she provides these vivid recollections of almond eyes and the way his warm hands cool my ill tattered mind . 
0.732 -- and again i turn these thoughts onto my own experience and life ... contemplations ... paranoias ... all bouncing off one another inside my brain . 
0.732 -- when my mind races with negative thoughts i need to remember to quite my mind and not feed the unwanted thoughts and feelings . 
0.732 -- cause everyone goes inside and then im left to me and my thoughts , and my thoughts like to wander a lot . 
0.732 -- and some of them brought the thoughts about death and life back to my mind . 
0.732 -- being with my warren guys keeps me distracted from the musings of my mind . 
0.732 -- analysing my thoughts on the day and the words that had passed through my eyes and into my brain mind soul whatever ... i miss seeing people . 
0.732 -- so i had my moment to take a stroll down memory lane ; engulfed with thoughts of my dear grandfather . 
0.732 -- my mind is filled with thoughts of my mom s parents , who hopefully are watching this from somewhere . 
0.732 -- my heart never wavers , though my voice tends to , as my tears swell and my memory roams , back to those days where a simple hello would knot my stomach and make my body race . 
0.732 -- somethings missing , somethings gone ... i slide into thoughts of your eyes ... my heart is in your smile . 
0.732 -- for now i wander into the corners of my mind , searching for the truth of my childhood . 
0.732 -- a flood of reminiscence distracts my mind , leaving me bereft of those golden days . 
0.732 -- she is always there , in my thoughts , hovering , waiting for my mind to wander . 
0.732 -- when these thoughts in my head and my soul is tattered and no longer a smile on my face when im away . 
0.732 -- dreams haunted his waking moments , ready to steal his mind the second his attention wandered or his focus drifted . 
0.732 -- my roommates grandma just died ... so its like i have the worst thoughts in my mind . 
0.732 -- everything that wanders through my mind seems to contradict itself which leaves me thinking more leading to no sleep and sometimes lots of tears . 
0.732 -- you left me shattered in pieces of obsidian my life is nothing but a wretched monument of a forgotten time a forgotten romance my heart still lies my mind gives up and dies . 
0.732 -- ... but these ghosts of whisps of flittering dreams playing through my mind haunt me whilst i sleep . 
0.732 -- on the bed shivering , so many thoughts running through my mind ... my whole life passing by . 
0.732 -- somewhere within the bowels of my psyche lies a memory of my childhood when summers would last forever and everyone was happy . 
0.732 -- the feelings , the emotions are rushing through me , my mind , my body , my soul , my heart . 
0.732 -- but at twilight when minds settle , my mind follows my heart back to you . 
0.732 -- i ended up wondering into the back room and looked through old , old , old pictures of my great grandparents , grampa and gramma , and my mom when she was little . 
0.732 -- but yet my mind wanders to before then ... like his graduation and his going away party . 
0.732 -- arrows fire and flowers pia your tears are the jewels decorating my heart you capture my mind like the moon then broken we meet you read my mind , i speak your workds together we breathe thoughts unspoken like frost on the pane my dance my light my heart blinded by my darkness i stumble then shadows perforated uncovered separated by arrow fire and flowers may your eyes your wandering eyes rest upon me come hold my hand and lead me through spiral whispers and maddening sighs then fate unfolds clutching at my heart stealing my thoughts settles , repose painful lessons like fire within my love my hope my heaven . 
0.732 -- i hate thinking like this , but sometimes when your mind wanders to dark places , new ideas pop into it . 
0.732 -- funky dreams last night , nasty things on my thoughts , suppose it was only time before it crept into my dreams . 
0.732 -- away from it all my mind wanders , inner twined with pure emotion , reaching out thought music . 
0.732 -- as the sleep comes over my body , my mind wanders to a place that is not so far . 
0.731 -- i haven t forgotten old desire , old love , old joy old dreams old aches awakened music written by men long dead comes to life hearts joys a hundred generations old alive , awake , dancing through my house ! 
0.731 -- my mind kept racing further back into my memory , pulling up those bittersweet stories of yesterday . 
0.731 -- these moments will become my hopes and fears ; my name and pseudonym ; my heart and soul and mind . 
0.731 -- my mind is gone my body is complaining and my emotions are dead ... just faded . 
0.731 -- she looks deep into my eyes for a few seconds before replying my love you are my world , my waking moments and my dreams . 
0.731 -- when i close my eyes , inside my heart , upon my mind and etched into my soul is where you will always be . 
0.731 -- he closes his eyes and lets his mind drift off to thoughts of nothingness and plays a soft classical melody in his mind . 
0.731 -- and , as my mind is wont to do , it wandered over to fannish thoughts and the bsg finale . 
0.731 -- so why is my mind so haunted with thoughts of the perfectly wrong boy ? 
0.731 -- she looks away from blindspot , grinning at the thoughts running through her mind . 
0.731 -- the demons that lurk beneath the surface of my awareness and wait for me to succumb to sleep to enter into my mind and play their tricks and lure my sanity to the brink of confusion leaving me to shake my head in wonder at the images left lingering around the fringes of my memory . 
0.731 -- i shivered , as thoughts of me being a solitary soul for life ran through my mind . 
0.731 -- all of the pictures of you , in my mind , in my mind ... repeat the same sorrowed path , in my mind , in my mind , in my mind ... pictures of you , these pictures of you .

0.726 -- letting my mind wander sings ... where it will goooo on good days my brain works something like this : 
0.726 -- it follows me in my path , seeps into my dreams , and lurks around my conscience . 
0.726 -- i remember thinking of how cute she looked , fighting the feelings that still stirred in the shallow recesses of my mind . 
0.726 -- so this year in my mind thoughts of hesitance and aprehension swarm my brain . 
0.726 -- and what to my wandering eyes should appear but ... one of my old middle school friends . 
0.726 -- obviously with your sekrit mind powers you looked into my brain from back in and stole my idea ! 
0.726 -- my mind is telling me to rid myself of everything that keeps me in my old frame of mind . 
0.726 -- new poem : figure me out if you stare into my eyes long enough , you may fall ; into my secrets ; into my lies ; into my passion . 
0.726 -- a girl to occupy my thoughts , and dance with me in my dreams .

0.726 -- my body begins to experience a trance and i am lost in the vivid imagery of my dreams . 
0.726 -- but that in vain comes back to haunt my very being my mind , my soul , my heart .

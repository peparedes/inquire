0.749 -- so it is sad ... but it does remind me of that night i spent with jen ... heh ... funny how little things spark such vivid memories . 
0.749 -- memories can make you laugh and smile it can also make you sad and cry .

0.749 -- why is it that bad childhood memories always have a stinging effect like a papercut ? 
0.749 -- so the kinds of songs that have just amazingly powerful lyrics but the lyrics arent specific so it lets your mind wander around about the meaning and in the end the lyrics mean whatever you want them to , the meaning is whatever feeling you get when you hear them and it could mean different things to different people but no matter what it means to you it s powerful and moving ... those are the most beautiful songs ever written ! 
0.749 -- it has moments both poignant and terrifying and if you can manage to catch it , you really ought to .

0.748 -- hmmm , its strange how a good song can influence your moods , how it can depress you , exite you , and sometimes make you feel like anything is possible . 
0.748 -- and its funny how good a song can make you feel for however long it plays . 
0.748 -- seriously , it s weird how songs can bring me back to a specific moment . 
0.748 -- and it s not very damn often that addy ever actually speaks his emotions and memories out loud to me . 
0.748 -- i m not sure i want to get into why each song was selected , but suffice to say every one of these conjures powerful memories and strong emotions .

0.748 -- ... u remember too many funny things about the past ... such good memories rite ? 
0.748 -- :) it s amazing how one person can conjure up such amazing feelings inside .

0.748 -- i can still remember his laugh and how funny he could be at the most random moments .

0.748 -- it s one of the highlights with a memorable melody and simple yet insightful lyrics if nobody sees you cry you can say it was raining outside . 
0.748 -- as pathetic as it is , i feel like a musical montage could be created consisting of fond memories of my relationship with that game set to a tegan and sara song , as it would be . 
0.748 -- i love songs that are beautiful , that adequately express painful or otherwise powerful feelings , but also make me smile at the complete perfection and temerity of life and emotional experiences . 
0.748 -- weird ones , like memories trying to come to the surface only their not memories . 
0.748 -- it s neat how such simple meetings with those you love turn into such lasting memories filled with joy . 
0.748 -- but there s just something more delicately beautiful and subtle about singing me your song instead , maybe because of the involvement of melody and how the lyrics to a song can sometimes be interpreted differently , depending on the individual s personal outlook on things . 
0.748 -- this song ... it just ... it is very powerful in such a soft , frightening , yet endearing way . 
0.748 -- i may like some of them as songs , but not as love songs , if that makes sense . 
0.748 -- it s so campy and funny that you can t help but to love listening to the words as the song goes on . 
0.748 -- that song evokes images from the show but it also just makes me feel wickedly devious somehow . 
0.748 -- lyrics : i love how lyrically rich the songs are there are so many images that stay with me even after listening to it just once . 
0.748 -- i think that has to be one of the most beautiful aspects about music ... how one simple song can have such a powerful effect on a person .

0.748 -- suddenly feel like listening to them sing ... most of the times when i hear certain song ... it reminds of the things that took place when the song was aired and became popular ... some are nice memories but some are not ... so the phrase that songs got sentimental value is very true ... 
0.748 -- we are doing emotional memory at the moment , and when the teacher talked to us about how sense memory can be used to bring emotions , emotional memory was also a useful technique to do that . 
0.748 -- i do miss the old times ... funny how easily simple happy not to mention carefree literally moments can be forgotten .

0.748 -- oh and the song you will pass away has a very cool combination of song title and how the music sounds . 
0.748 -- only one of the songs that i can tell explores any less than cheery topic ; it used to be a common thing that you could make a danceable tune that might open up some disturbing content should someone listen to the lyrics . 
0.748 -- saddest song makes you sad : sorry about that alkaline trio , though someone else already said it song with most personal memories attached : ha , rehab , lbc , crossbread , static x song you re embarrassed to say you enjoy : probally the new korn song song that you ll never get sick of : all greenday best love song : poison the well nerdy or a bleeder strange i know last song you heard : some song off the new super joint ritual cd most annoying song : oh sooo many , i think the new trapt song or any rap song that is played on the radio 8) most currenly overplayed song : the new staind song .

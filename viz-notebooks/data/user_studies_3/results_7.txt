0.748 -- no doubt ... tragic kingdom name a song that reminds you of someone and why : to many ... those songs acan be pretty depressing too ... 
0.748 -- i also sing songs that rhyme in dreams , and that are very powerful , and then can t remember the lyrics when i wake up , only the feelings associated with them . 
0.748 -- suddenly feel like listening to them sing ... most of the times when i hear certain song ... it reminds of the things that took place when the song was aired and became popular ... some are nice memories but some are not ... so the phrase that songs got sentimental value is very true ... 
0.748 -- we are doing emotional memory at the moment , and when the teacher talked to us about how sense memory can be used to bring emotions , emotional memory was also a useful technique to do that . 
0.748 -- i do miss the old times ... funny how easily simple happy not to mention carefree literally moments can be forgotten . 
0.748 -- it makes you cry with joy at how wonderful and beautiful everything around you is even if sometimes the lyrics can be a little sad . 
0.748 -- funny how sometimes you come home from the happiest day and write a song that makes you sound like you re over the edge . 
0.748 -- and it s funny how a song can be so perfect for the moment and everything just ... comes together ... in a sad way . 
0.748 -- it s like a parody of the beach boys song good vibrations , but you know how most parodies are funny but kinda stupid ? 
0.748 -- xd ; ; it s funny how stuff that you couldn t even remember before brings back so many memories .

0.748 -- oh and the song you will pass away has a very cool combination of song title and how the music sounds . 
0.748 -- only one of the songs that i can tell explores any less than cheery topic ; it used to be a common thing that you could make a danceable tune that might open up some disturbing content should someone listen to the lyrics . 
0.748 -- saddest song makes you sad : sorry about that alkaline trio , though someone else already said it song with most personal memories attached : ha , rehab , lbc , crossbread , static x song you re embarrassed to say you enjoy : probally the new korn song song that you ll never get sick of : all greenday best love song : poison the well nerdy or a bleeder strange i know last song you heard : some song off the new super joint ritual cd most annoying song : oh sooo many , i think the new trapt song or any rap song that is played on the radio 8) most currenly overplayed song : the new staind song . 
0.748 -- be it a memory , knowing its a song that a friend really loves , or jsut the raw emotion in the songs . 
0.748 -- do you ever have a song that you just love love love because the melody is so freaking catchy even though some of the lyrics are kind of lame ? 
0.748 -- it s amazing how much emotion and nostalgia one can draw from a single song ... or many , in the case of this soundtrack . 
0.748 -- if memories make the person then i say go out and make as many interesting memories as you can ! 
0.748 -- a song that makes you think of old crushes , friends , and embarrassing yet fun as hell moments ? 
0.748 -- who knows what happens after that , maybe some playful ass kicking or something with some friends involved ... ... it s weird how a certain smell can bring back so many memories ... 
0.748 -- loneliness : the stills of montreal reason : mix of clean and heavily distorted melancholy guitar with a cool drumline and sad lyrics that are just vague enough that you can let them mean what you want . 
0.748 -- : use a song lyric describing how you feel about me when we are together : use a song lyric describing how you feel about me overall : use a song lyric describing my personality : use a song lyric describing how you think i feel inside : use a song lyric desribing our relationship : please answer ... copy if u want and use it too . 
0.748 -- the music video for this song might be fucking hilarious , but it kind of makes you forget that the song itself is incredibly hot . 
0.748 -- but , you do know your way around a song , and your voice can also be wickedly sexy and charming . 
0.748 -- describe one memory you have that surrounds a particular song , which will immediately pop into your head when you hear it , and name the song too . 
0.748 -- yunnie sounds cute , his voice is not too low if not high in the song ... a very inspirational , delightful song .

0.747 -- so many great memories and truly funny times ... it is just odd how we are such good pals in such a short amount of time . 
0.747 -- lunch made me laugh today so hard ... dirty ole oh and also , question of the day : if you could your feelings of life love , friends , family , etc ... into lyrics , which lyric and by who ? 
0.747 -- not just any song , not just a song that you think is really great ... i mean the kind of song that you will be able to appreciate when you are old and crippled ... and will always spur both certain emotion , and wonderful memories ... that s what it s all about ... that little bit of wonder , that you will never be able to replace with anything other than those silly little lyrics and poor instrumentals ... 
0.747 -- uuuuuugh xdxdxd also , it boggles the mind how a ridiculously pretty boy like shou can sing with such a deep voice . 
0.747 -- its amazing to me how your unconscious mind can let go of such emotionally damaging images and ideas when it seems that you re the most vulnerable . 
0.747 -- its funny how looking at pictures can bring up some heartfelt emotion that you have long buried within yourself , and how a song can remind you of a certain time in your life , can pinpoint your exact location , age , and emotion . 
0.747 -- funny generally sums up stein s feelings at the moment , but the lyrics are generic enough that they could be applied to any situation , and sadly , as anyone who knows how life generally treats me could attest , it could also be my personal theme song . 
0.747 -- the song s lyrics are quite interesting to me too ... and in a way , also quite beautiful . 
0.747 -- the movie as silly as this sounds helps me to remember that even the , saddest of situations can turn out well . 
0.747 -- they have lyrics that are simple but not stale , powerful but not sappy , and very easy to relate to . 
0.747 -- song of truth simple minds how often do you hear a britney spears song that has a somewhat meaningful title ? 
0.747 -- isn t it strange how sometimes some song lyrics or poems can completely reflect how you feel at a certain moment in time . 
0.747 -- so without further ado , i bring you ... songs that sound upbeat and catchy , but which are actually really depressing when you listen to the lyrics list as many as you can think of , and discuss . 
0.747 -- i like these lyrics particularly ; they say that music can alter moods and talk to you , well can it load a gun up for you , and cock it too ? 
0.747 -- this song always makes me smile and touches you that maynard , filled with caged anger can do this sweet gentle song dedicated to his mother s memory . 
0.747 -- it tears people apart ... ruins friendships ... breaks peoples hearts ... its so weird how one song can make you think of so many different things ... things that happened , things you did when you heard the song , things that a song makes you feel ... just alotta things . 
0.747 -- tragic tunes so sad or so bad that you can t help bursting into tears ... followed by a list of several sad and bad songs . 
0.747 -- and you sit there and you laugh at how cliched the songs are and how silly they sound sometimes and you dont really believe that it s anything much past a few lines slapped together with a pretty melody to make someone rich and famous . 
0.747 -- : because it brings back extremely good memories what band singer ... is easy for you to relate to ? 
0.747 -- most of my entries contain music lyrics just because there are so many awesome songs out there that relate to longterm or everyday circumstances and emotions . 
0.747 -- i must have these horrible repressed memories of someone taunting me saying katy lindeman because it always sounds belittleing or something which one of your friends acts the most like you ? 
0.747 -- the lyrics to this song are so sublimely wonderful that i can use no words to describe how well they fit me and agree with my insides . 
0.747 -- you should be a song writer you have the ability to evoke emotion , tell a story , and hook someone ... in a very small amount of words , perhaps with some deft rhyming . 
0.747 -- i usually find it hard to pull the emotion from the words like i could easily do with song lyrics . 
0.747 -- but feelings such as these are uncomparable ... for they are caused by something so small , a little song that got , at best , one little summer of radio play , and yet ... this little song brings up so many wonderful memories ... ah ... this ... my friends , is the incredible power of music . 
0.747 -- the songs are actually catchy , and it pokes such sweet , gentle fun at the folk genre that i can t help but love it . 
0.747 -- funny how our mind and brain works , out of chemicals that shoot through your body , a tiny molecule captures these thoughts and memories we remember . 
0.747 -- images from your childhood and adolescence could come to you during times of withdrawal , and these could bring back both beautiful and painful memories . 
0.747 -- isnt it weird how you can like a song and never fully understand the lyrics unless you read them without the music ? 
0.747 -- summer lyric also added in a few references to contemporary life , too , which can sometimes be really corny and annoying , but in this case was really funny . 
0.747 -- those two songs touch my soul ... and when a song can do such a thing to me , then it is very good ! 
0.747 -- it may sound supremely silly , but a great song can be so deep , so melodic it s like you re floating .

0.747 -- quizid &gt; grab code you should be a song writer you have the ability to evoke emotion , tell a story , and hook someone ... in a very small amount of words , perhaps with some deft rhyming . 
0.747 -- it s weird how fast memories can come and well the new and old can blend together , mixing to make a cocktail of pain . 
0.747 -- one of your most tragic memories : loss of the sugar :( , one of your angriest memories : a few a couple recetly i wont get into ... :/ a memory that makes you laugh : too many ... choir trips , all my crusing nights etc ... a memory that makes you happy : ... something someone can say or do that you find extremely attractive : sing ! 
0.747 -- but i can tell you instantly what all of these films have that funny face does not : wit , relevance , and resonance . 
0.747 -- songs that we used to love now harbor bad memories , movies we used to love remind us of something that happened with that person . 
0.747 -- important ; &gt; special skills : able to be in a band without knowing how to play an instrument , can make simple graphics , can make simple layouts , can write livejournal entries a day and never get bored , easily writes beginnings and endings of stories , she also has the ability to make most of her best friends laugh with corny jokes . 
0.747 -- it holds so many emotions and memories and brings me back to that time when i listen to it , but in a cathartic way . 
0.747 -- that song that i sang is perhaps one of my favorite songs because of how beautiful the lyrics are and so true .

0.746 -- that music can define situations and hold onto memories allowing you to relive these moments with a clarity that is unbelievable . 
0.746 -- memories are funny that way , they tend to have one over riding emotion that buries all the others . 
0.746 -- brain power goes to song lyrics ... the other goes to remembering movie scripts ... : oh of course , would you like a container for your joy ? 
0.746 -- that smell evokes such interesting and wonderful memories ... it brings me back to the fairy tale life i used to have . 
0.746 -- , crazy , forever yes , so my current or latest mood is encapsulated and interwoven into the lyrics and melodies of all those songs . 
0.746 -- funny how fire is catchy ... how testimonies hurt your heart and knowing that people are praying for you brings so many things to the surface . 
0.746 -- it is a song so i have written them below so u can sing them with the funny little song video thing ... hint : try to add a country swang sound it is so funny thats how the baby says it ! 
0.746 -- what song reminds you of that special someone : well , me and ktz have many songs ... oh .

0.746 -- sighs it is the fond memories you have that get you through moments like these or so they say . 
0.746 -- it s actually a pretty fun album , and most of the songs are not terribly hard on the ears , especially if you fancy singing along with whimsical , sometimes extremely weird lyrics . 
0.746 -- what do amazing lyrics matter if the melody is so dull that you can t remember how they go ? 
0.746 -- will these memories fade when i leave this town i love it when a song captures those emotions that are so difficult to express yourself . 
0.746 -- yet , its so satisfying this feeling of connectedness with someone who could not only read you like a book , but write you as a poem , sing you as a hymn ... so beautiful , yet terrifyingly vulnerable . 
0.746 -- he can write some nice , melodic not overly long songs , which is the type of music i like . 
0.746 -- song song song this one s pretty easy ... though the answer might not be quite as simple as what might come immediately to mind . 
0.746 -- these thrity four orchestrated hybrid instrumentals are haunting , eerie , mysterious , melancholy , and ultimately powerful , capturing the feel of the movie so well that you need not have seen it to experience it .

0.746 -- hm ... well the actual songs don t make me cry but maybe the memories that come along with that song what song makes you happy ? 
0.746 -- funny how something as silly as strumming incorrectly on the guitar can make me angry enough to hit someone . 
0.746 -- and as time goes by and more memories are created , the past events and memories fade until they become the faint tune of a song you once heard but can t quite remember the words to .

0.746 -- maybe the biggest difference between these songs and a north american tune is that where , say , bruce cockburn might use metaphors and references to theories and the news , these songs name people , describe houses , specific memories , and so this song especially has a lot of impact for me . 
0.746 -- song that makes you want to close your ears : most opm novelty songs song that makes you think of that special someone : crazy for you song that makes you feel relaxed : breathe michelle branch song that makes you feel inspired : untitled simple plan song that makes you want to sing along : all or nothing some boy band ... you are mostly known as ?

0.746 -- personality feature : funny smart if you could kiss one famous &gt; musician &lt; who would it be and why ? 
0.746 -- : use a song lyric describing how you feel about me when we are together : use a song lyric describing how you feel about me overall : use a song lyric describing my personality : use a song lyric describing how you think i feel inside : use a song lyric desribing our relationship : i would be uber grateful . 
0.746 -- fuck is such a powerful word ... you can put power and meaning into things and also make things funny . 
0.746 -- great song , love the ending and the lyrics , they re quite easy to relate to during rainy days like these . 
0.746 -- or how one movie , or painting , or conversation , or song , or memory can make you so happy to be alive , so warm , so fulfilled , so real , while also filling you with a visceral , inhospitable rush of bone chilling lonliness and sadness . 
0.746 -- sometimes i d like to get rid of the bad memories but i fear doing so would also cause me to loose the memories of good moments and those good moments are far to valuable to risk . 
0.746 -- i love it when movies film can evoke some sort of emotional reaction out of me , it happens oh so rarely these days . 
0.746 -- like making music , people can relate to the lyrics , and i know how the tones can impact things . 
0.746 -- it s funny how some stories that can stress me out forever can all of a sudden find inspiration in the idea of one still of one scene . 
0.746 -- memories one of your most peaceful memories : i duno thats a weird question one of your most tragic memories : my grandmas dog died ... one of your angriest memories : mah daddie a memory that makes you laugh : almost anytime me and hope do something a memory that makes you happy : i can t think right now ! 
0.746 -- you will recall situations , memories , people , and remember how you felt during those certain someones and memories but yet when you think back it just doesnt add up the way it used to . 
0.746 -- song you hope no one finds out you like breathe on me britney spears song that brings bad memories some cbl , clocks coldplay song that brings good memories cbl , tranceport music is one of the most important parts of life ... yes or no ? 
0.746 -- in many ways , it seems that music is similar to scent in that it can instantaneously call to mind past experiences , memories , or emotions . 
0.746 -- and the songs are catchy and awesome hearts ; if you have listened to their music and liked it , shock , what is your favourite song or some of them ? 
0.746 -- songs that would never be listened to if it weren t for the memories attached to them , songs with lyrics that match a specific situation or people exactly , songs that make you feel something whether it be a depressing numbness or an uncontrollable in your hips , but mainly songs that just sound good and make you say , yeah . 
0.746 -- but when you try to write lyrics that are trying really hard to be really witty or funny , and fail misery , the result is agonizing pain on the listener s behalf . 
0.746 -- it s funny how when u are going thru something emotional there are so many songs on the radio u can relate to . 
0.746 -- it is amazing how one song can remind you of a girl , a friend , a special moment . 
0.745 -- funny how i currently identify with some of the lyrics from a few songs , namely hero , and someday . 
0.745 -- as long as i can remember i remember that man ... my childhood memories are haunted by visions of his hardened features and sweet , sweet melodies . 
0.745 -- and then i will be remembered for writing such an amazing song , that so many can relate to . 
0.745 -- i remember things better when there s something musical involved in the memory , and i can memorize lyrics melodies quickly . 
0.745 -- there are many reasons , from childhood memories , to a connection with most of their lyrics , to appreciation of what amazing sounds they managed to create then string together into a new definition of music . 
0.745 -- yet again , a song that carla can relate to ... that sounds a whole lot like her love life . 
0.745 -- but then again it also feels really good when you hear a song that is associated with a moment and good memories flood into your brain . 
0.745 -- it s funny how i can relate the lyrics to this song to a lot of things in my life . 
0.745 -- it s weird cuz certain songs , pictures , and smells are all taking me back to wonderful memories , and well ... it s all very difficult . 
0.745 -- it s such a real song so many human emotions that i think anyone whose been in love can relate to . 
0.745 -- the five factor personality test you should be a song writer you have the ability to evoke emotion , tell a story , and hook someone ... in a very small amount of words , perhaps with some deft rhyming . 
0.745 -- you also do not know what inspirations cause people to write such poetry and music , so your inspired by that person , and song . 
0.745 -- sometimes i don t like it when songs bring back memories cause it ruins the whole song for you . 
0.745 -- there is something so rich and so real about his lyrics ... they capture heartache in such a vivid way . 
0.745 -- the lyrics seem to have new meaning to me now , it s funny how girlys can effect my taste in music , heh . 
0.745 -- who what makes you sad : boys emotions emotion you hide most : sadness the emotion you tend to experience most : recently sadness but i m usually pretty happy the emotion you are feeling most lately : laziness you have a huge amount of guilt regarding : things i ve said before i thought them through when you are angry you need : to vent and let all my anger out when you are sentimental you need : to be held ... when you are in love you need : memories one of your most peaceful memories : wow thats hard one of your most tragic memories : losing my grandpa one of your angriest memories : i have many a memory that makes you happy : beach with misti something someone can say or do that you find extremely attractive : dance like they know what they re doing , play the guitar piano drums , and be aggresive something someone can say or do that you find unattractive : be an ass to my friends , dress really bad , say stupid shit and act like its funny a personality trait you find appealing : humor your secret passion : hmm sshhh , its not a secret if i tell ! 
0.745 -- but it s funny how such beautiful things can remind you of memories you don t want to have . 
0.745 -- ok , so i think music is a reflection of an artist lyricist composer etc s feelings and emotions and a good song is one you can hear once and forever link that song with a particular emotion . 
0.745 -- not sort of chuckle funny like most of the songs on the album , but actually laugh out loud funny . 
0.745 -- me and mike were thinking that we would like to use a song that they sing called alien love song it s such a beautiful song and just what it says saying that neither space or time could ruin their perfect love ... sometimes makes me cry lol . 
0.745 -- it s also nice to know that sweet moments you still remember can be so easily forgotten by other people . 
0.745 -- like , songs with such sweet lyrics , but the song is suddenly de valued because you realize that you re listening to nsync . 
0.745 -- it s weird how when you listen to lyrics in songs , most of the time it feels like they were written for the situation you are in , it s so easy to relate to most lyrics . 
0.745 -- : i wish song that makes you cry : right now it s free bird most memorable song : anything by mazzy star best type of music : i love all kinds song that makes you dance : def lep pour some sugar on me remember when ... most embarrassing memory : when i fell in front of floyd most hurtful memory : when me and gil were breaking up memory that makes you happy : niko overall best memory : niko anything you regret ? 
0.745 -- not that it means much to most people , but here s a few words that i use to describe me that my cheesy stupid sun sign agrees with : emotional , sensitive , protective , moody , dynamic , intuitive and empathetic . 
0.745 -- that movie brought backa bunch of feelings that i couldnt tell if they were real or just memories , turns out memories . 
0.745 -- it s funny how one little thing that probably doesn t even matter can bring back so many emotions and memories from the past . 
0.745 -- a really really fun song , that sounds so coooool with their voices together wicked what is this feeling omigosh , this song is so fuuunny , it s more a giggly one wicked popular this song is so gorgeous , and such a turning point for the plot . 
0.745 -- so many good songs , so many laughs , smiles , and so many treasured memories of sharing the music with friends . 
0.745 -- not that i didnt wanna help ... but it brings back memories ... memories that used to be soooo beautiful ... yet it hurts me more to give it another thought . 
0.745 -- if i could sum up all my feelings in a song it would be sad romance the song is sexy yet powerful 
0.745 -- they have an uncanny ability to bring images to your mind as you listen to the songs that are hauntingly geourgous .

0.744 -- i think that the reason for that is that when you hear certain songs they bring back memories and the nostalgia makes you sad . 
0.744 -- lyrics , tunes , script , movies back to front , it s weird how you have memories for oddities but you don t remember the simplist items . 
0.743 -- all the memories are also a bad thing cause they make me wanna have more memories of these people . 
0.743 -- it s crazy how one simple song can suddenly bring back sooooooo many memories and make you miss someone and just his presence in your life ... even if he was an asshole sometimes .

0.743 -- have you ever had a memory so vivid , and so random that it just makes you incredibly emotional ? 
0.743 -- before i start this , it s amazing how lyrics from a song will tend to so accurately describe what you re feeling at the moment . 
0.743 -- memories may be beautiful and yet , what s too painful to rememeber , we simply choose to forget . 
0.743 -- so who cares how crappy the song is , you ll always have that memory when ever you hear the song . 
0.743 -- the song can be sad , energetic , or even crazy songs with epic solos and insane riffs and have lyrics , or me lyrics take away from the song . 
0.743 -- on another note ... its amazing how a silly song can almost perfectly depict your feelings , and even weirder a whole night . 
0.743 -- it s quite a clever idea ; i love seeing how someone s mind works , linking a song you may not first think of as a vidding song to a certain show . 
0.743 -- it s such a sweet song , i wish someone would feel that for me , but those emotions are only in songs and good literature . 
0.743 -- me and charli used to have so many inside , secret , stupid little teenage girl jokes between us ... omg , so many song lyrics , songs , movies , one liners , all that kind of shit . 
0.743 -- how is that so many kind words can be exchanged , so many little giggles and happy memories within such a short amount of time ? 
0.743 -- like the lyrics and music are so powerful and you can tell in the guys voice that he s feeling this . 
0.743 -- my mom said i can and should go so that s a big plus right there ... it really weird who the most random of things can evoke certain emotions and memories of things long past ; certain memories you ve tried to forget or how situations seems to be the same as ones that have passed . 
0.743 -- great music , familiar enough to sense their influences but diverse enough from song to song to be interesting , and layered enough within each song to have me liking them more and more as the set developed . 
0.743 -- song that makes you cry : river joni mitchell , its such a simple song , but so powerful , i love it . 
0.743 -- its amazing how much power a song can have , how just a few bars can bring back any memory sharp as if it happened just yesterday . 
0.743 -- who what makes you happy : singin along to a good song who what makes you sad : everything emotions emotion you hide most : the emotion that makes me cry at night the emotion you tend to experience most : so many at once , too many to list the emotion you are feeling most lately : regret you have a huge amount of guilt regarding : stupid actions when you are angry you need : to smoke a ciggarete , listen to music , got up to my fav spot on the mountain and just stair at the city and think when you are sentimental you need : to forget when you are in love you need : to be happy with what i have before its gone again memories one of your most peaceful memories : holding her one of your most tragic memories : doing drugs one of your angriest memories : in th grade watching a girl get hurt cause a guy tripped her purposley . 
0.743 -- does my brain just have an epic sense of humour and want to cheer me up at random moments with bizarrely humorous memories ?

0.743 -- wish you were a member of the opposite sex : sometimes cried because of someone s mean words : one too many times favorites song lyrics : im insecurities could eat me alive ! 
0.743 -- i also keep thinking about the memories that go with the song and how life was when that song was popular . 
0.743 -- i also find it curious that a single song can bring memories of when you first heard it under cirumstances you d rather forget , and then also remind you of a person pleasant memory though there was never a connection made between that person and that song . 
0.743 -- what songs do i feel most tell the story of my life with their lyrics , harmonies , and emotions evoked ? 
0.743 -- how is it that one love song ... the song that you first danced to ... can kill a good mood ... how is it that it can totally depress you with the first few notes ? 
0.743 -- everclear can be like that , but a lot of the times , their songs are straightforward , and it s scary how excruciatingly on target thier lyrics can be relating to something in your life . 
0.743 -- though you may see similarities between you and a given character , it s not the same as the completely visceral reaction a song can provide , those rare moments when it seems to really be soundtracking your life . 
0.743 -- you know , taken out of context , this song could make a good theme song for quite a few lovecraftian horror tales . 
0.743 -- if you like power pop and cleverly written songs that are incredibly catchy , they are probably for you . 
0.743 -- and i can put things like quotes , pictures , song lyrics , photos , and stuff like that in there too ... does that sound like a good idea ? 
0.743 -- if dreams are like movies then memories are films about ghosts well there s a piece of maria in every song that i sing and the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings we shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars well , you can see a million miles tonight but you can t get very far 
0.743 -- and it gets to me sometimes how all these unpleasant memories and random words friends said to me can be stored in this pea brain of mine . 
0.743 -- i think it s so fascinating that simple images , scents and songs can remind you of people or events in your life in such great detail . 
0.743 -- one song that can describe you my chemical romance i m not okay one song that makes you wanna kill someone saosin seven years , a static lullaby a song for a broken heart one word that can describe you never heard of it alone what song to you would make you feel better after a hard day silverstein giving up , alexisonfire the kennedy curse what s a song someone s dedicated to you love song what s a song you ve dedicated to someone a cursive memory the piano song name bands on your playlist a cursive memory , best tomorrow , a static lullaby , hawthorne heights , saosin , simply lost , my chemical romance , atreyu , alexisonfire , armor for sleep , song that makes you happy best tomorrow ready or not song that makes you depressed armor for sleep slip like space taste in music emo screamo do you have high or low self esteem low if you could make yourself a better person would you ? 
0.743 -- some songs just remind me of a certain place , and time , a moment captured perfectly that can be relived whenever you hear that song again . 
0.743 -- these are songs that come immediately to mind as songs the i know enough words to sing along to , and know the song well enough that any awkward phrasings won t kill me . 
0.743 -- i mean , yes , music does have healing properties and sometimes the right words are best said through song , but i tend to view songs crafted in response to global events as , well , cheesy , contrived , and tacky . 
0.743 -- they help you store the most intimate and beautiful memories that you may sometimes forget as years go by . 
0.743 -- it s funny how you can be in a gut wrenchingly painful situation and god can use it for the good . 
0.743 -- and it s strange how the smallest clip of a song can bring back a flood of memories ... i haven t sung that song in forever , i remember writing out the lyrics in gold ... i remember so much , and it doesnt hurt me anymore . 
0.743 -- you can even explain why you like it ... perhaps it brings back fond memories , or you re simply a music nerd who loves the way it was produced or arranged . 
0.743 -- not because lyrically they have anything to do with me , but because those two songs are connected with some of the most vivid memories of my childhood . 
0.743 -- theres alot of em song that makes you smile : hands down by dashboard song that makes you cry : your house by alanis morrisette song that means a lot to you : intermission by unsung zeros song that relates to your current life : so much by the spill canvas masterpiece by bayside song that makes you think : any bright eyes song personality are you funny or serious ? 
0.743 -- i listened to something corporate today for the first time in like or months and dude ... it s so crazy how a song or band or whatever can bring back such vivid memories .

0.743 -- when you are in love you need : to be loved back memories one of your most peaceful memories : idk ... ive had a few one of your most tragic memories : blah . 
0.743 -- that s a little odd yet , damn , did that theme song bring back a lot of childhood memories . 
0.743 -- :( one memory with this song : when a friend remarked in his offhand way that the song starts with morse code , how can it be bad ? 
0.743 -- there are all the inside jokes , lyrics to songs , memories with friends and family , our minds are truly fascinating and i just thought i should let everybody know that .

0.743 -- their vocalist sounds vaguely like billy corgan , they re undeniably rockin but know how to use a synthesizer , and their lyrics have great imagery , no matter which song you listen to . 
0.743 -- what you need : medication strength , a year of pent up frustration and misunderstood feelings , depressing music , powerful emotional visuals , one post extremely close friend , combine medication , feelings and music , slowly fold in emotional visuals , and add that special ingredient , friend . 
0.743 -- i can most definitely relate to the lyrics of their songs , it is almost kind of eerie how common in mind we appear to be at first lyrical glance . 
0.743 -- peace easy foolz , freshy fresh memories can be beautiful and yet , what s to painful to remember we simply choose to forget . 
0.743 -- the songs can be any song for any reasons , whether you can relate to the lyrics , whether you just think it sounds great or if it reminds you of someone special . 
0.743 -- how can a beautiful , amazing creature such as himself with such a powerful personality and so much love ... how can he love me so much ? 
0.743 -- music is a wonderful thing as it not only is catchy but it can help capture your emotions and release stress . 
0.743 -- even though you re screaming your way in each song , your lyrics have powerful messages , thoughts and feelings . 
0.743 -- music sets the scene for our most memorable moments in television , but greater still music can inspire in us a flood of memories good and bad just by hearing a few simple notes of the song . 
0.743 -- i taught myself long ago that thinking was a powerful and dangerous thing , it can paint a picture of your wildest and most loved fantasies or rip apart your mental being with searing pain from memories that need not be kept . 
0.743 -- how can calcium protiens and thign sin my mind hold memories , how can these memories determine if i exist .

0.743 -- i really like to see if the lyrics fit the song , as well as what they mean , and what kind of emotion feeling the song is trying to convey . 
0.743 -- the sad part is my memory does not serve to remember all these memories , most of them are vague images that i remember , or stories . 
0.743 -- they all sound really simple and stupid , but it made it such a fun day and left me with a lot of fond memories . 
0.743 -- where you listen to a song and you remember all the old memories from when you used to listen to that song .

0.742 -- =) i remember all these songs and all the feelings they used to provoke and it takes me right back to that incredibly lit garage . 
0.742 -- don t you love songs that bring back such a great memory that you can smell old smells and remember how the air felt and the way the stars looked ? 
0.742 -- and the lyrics usually sting pangs of pain into my heart but there are lyrics which relate to me quite blatantly ... like blatantly , the song might as well be named after me ffs and it does nothing .

0.742 -- yesturday insert some of your favourite song lyrics : sing like you think no ones listening how many big secrets do you have ? 
0.742 -- slow and sappy ballads regarding various emotions as you can guess and anybody who knows me and has ridden in my car at least once , can attest to , these songs include s love ballads , sad and depressing alternative rock metal songs regarding depression and never achieving one s goals , or crappy pop songs that also express love and needing that special someone . 
0.742 -- i love having the memories of those thoughts and the friends that make those memories so memorable , if you will .

0.742 -- the song , which is set to a beautiful melody , was powerful enough to move me to tears and it still does when i hear it . 
0.742 -- and a bunch of false memories sometimes which is tragic , really , because it makes me interact with people in these strange moods . 
0.742 -- somehow you can see how such a beautiful place or a beautiful life can allow for a certain amount of melancholy and still sing .

0.742 -- this simple fact is what can make a repetitive stupid song that sounds good be better than a deep long song . 
0.742 -- i can no longer listen to my favorite song from wicked , defying gravity , because ... sighs memories . 
0.742 -- far too good , and that song just encapsulates all the angst you could feel and turns it into something amazing and fun and energetic . 
0.742 -- in other news ... it s funny how all songs can seem to be related to sadness or loneliness or being left or whatever , if you feel like that ... i remember how easy it was to find songs for when rey and jaz were making lists of heartfelt songs a while ago ... and how all the music i listened too after breaking up with keegan , which is recent enough that i remember it , seemed to relate , in a bad way which made me stop listening to music on my computer and go bitch to jaz about musicians and breakups . 
0.742 -- you know when youre listening to a song , and it invokes such feelings in you that you wish the song was two hours long ? 
0.742 -- ughhhhhhhhhhhhh ... have you ever found one of those songs where the lyrics are just so expressive powerful significant ? 
0.742 -- it can be rather violent , and really graphic gory , but it can also be really funny and sweet . 
0.742 -- good lyrics can make me love a song whose music is not the greatest ; but good music cannot make me like a song whose lyrics suck . 
0.742 -- i can remember going through some old cd s quite some time ago , listening to that mesmerizing tone ... it s a soothing , melancholy voice , that can detail emotion so well , it moves one to tears . 
0.742 -- but you must listen to the whole song ... it does not start out as the coolest song ever , but : into the song it becomes incredibly clever .

0.742 -- music videos some songs are so emotional and from the heart that you can t help but have a sad video . 
0.742 -- it turned out to be an incredibly nostalgic experience , as i d forgotten just how many good memories are attached to that film . 
0.742 -- any emptiness inside of you , no matter how small , can unconsciously emerge into a feeling of sadness and self pity ... and so if a song is able to cause sad feelings in you , i say there must be a personal reason why , even if it has nothing to do with the lyrics of the song . 
0.742 -- it seems harder to write an allegorical song that invokes vivid mental images that make you say , yeah , that s cool how he she did that ! 
0.742 -- it can be anything , a simple gesture made by a stranger which sparks some memory of a past event person , an ad which contains an image of something that affects you in some way , or a song lyric which you can relate to more than you realised . 
0.742 -- she dubbed some music over his lyrics ... it s quit invigorating ... sometimes sad , sometimes funny ... but always intelligent .

0.742 -- its silly how watching the sopranos can make me nostalgic ... but certain words , phrases , behaviors ... it brings back many years and many people . 
0.742 -- that said , i seem to get instantly sad , touched , weepy , whatever word you want to use over the sappiest sentimental things ; commercials , songs , tv scenes . 
0.742 -- it s strange , and sometimes vaguely frightening , how strongly a song can be tied to a certain place time . 
0.742 -- like when memories dictate a particular song and forever associate it with a time or circumstance ... what do you do when its a person and not a song ? 
0.742 -- oh yeah to all of those who listen to a pillows song and say its too upbeat well you should read some of the translated lyrics ... in the song smile one of the lyrics is fuck you , humans ... how do ya like them apples ?

0.742 -- on a similar note ... isn t it ironic how you can know so many songs , yet only really hear what the lyrics say when you can relate ? 
0.742 -- it s the song and the melody , the memories it brings ... even those which may never have passed .

0.742 -- i m not saying all memories cause pain or fear or love ; only memories that are true memories and will last you your entire life , the memories that make you knees weak when something reminds you , when some small timid piece of life portrays itself in your path and puts a gun between your eyes lock stock and a smoking barrel as lead bullets of feelings , longing , hurt , love , and the most beautiful of times are poured directly into your mind only to swim for a while until it has time to reload and fire again . 
0.742 -- but remembering how i once was and how things used to be caused a new painful emotion to form deep inside of me .

0.741 -- hell yeah , even makes up songs , seeing how many times the word penis can be used in a song ! 
0.741 -- considering i find of most popular music s lyrics banal , stupid and or outright insulting , i find most trance lyrics to be pretty neat : not too heavy , not to distracting from the music , and occasionaly , finding a gem , a small bit of vocals that i tune into , one a verse that the author gives the listener the benefit of the doubt and trusts them to interpret it to their pleasure and just love . 
0.741 -- here is the list of , all of which it fulfills : cheesy song mention of jesus and mary nausiating lyrics bouncy sad depressing but strangely soothing mentions love mentions the future of love some freaky and pretty bit it can be easily done of kareoke even if done badly it is not so annoying that you want to rip the speakers out or chew you ears off little drummer boy ? 
0.741 -- because in my heart of hearts , i know that songs relate just as easily to experiences , feelings , other people ... music has that kind of incredible , terrible , awe inspiring power .

0.741 -- it not only helps me assign a year age to some of my already existing memories , but it s even helping to spark a few other memories ... just simple things like conversations i had , friends who crushed on specific pop stars , and things like that . 
0.741 -- on music you know those songs that evoke everything that you ever loved about a single moment in time all in another moment of time , and the two are forever linked everytime you hear that song ? 
0.741 -- when sometimes music is literally the soundtrack to your life , at a very specific time and it can be so powerful . 
0.741 -- current music lyrics : old rap is funny but cool to listen too do the ditty ditty if you want too . 
0.741 -- it s so annoying how sometimes i remember a funny story and no one around can relate to it . 
0.741 -- it brought back a childhood memory ... those memories that you so quickly forget , but so quickly remember . 
0.741 -- it s like a song will make me remember something , and then that memory will like bring up a specific feeling .

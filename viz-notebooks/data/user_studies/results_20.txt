0.771 -- so one resolution is to be on a more well balanced , nutritious diet . 
0.771 -- snack cups , and bratwurst , and ... hang on just realized that should probably clarify what low carb dieting , as i do it , is : keep all non fiber intake for the day at no more than grams , with being optimal . 
0.771 -- this might be a different thought come another week or so , but i really do know that my body needs what it needs and a calorie is a calorie is a calorie , no matter what the hell you are eating . 
0.771 -- well i just realized the other day how much sodium diet soda has ... about mg a can ... quite a lot .

0.771 -- it is called the fat flush diet and it is a low carb , sort of organic , holistic version of the atkins diet . 
0.771 -- calories is a little strict , but it s not an unreasonable diet caloric level for someone trying to get some serious weight off . 
0.771 -- in trying not to exceed my calorie intake for the day , i opt for empty calories in the form of cakes and chips than a proper meal . 
0.771 -- i would reccomend a vegetarian lifestyle as the work involved in growing veggies is a little less , but the fat content is far lower also and so the risk of eating more fat than you burned growing your meal is reduced .

0.771 -- no not a diet to lose weight but just to make healthier food choices and experiment with new ideas . 
0.771 -- ugh ... diets and fashion and exercise and all that fun stuff ... so i m starting this kinda diet that goes along with weight watchers where you can only eat a certain amount of calories per day . 
0.771 -- the only thing i ve eaten today is two sandwiches and a bag of hula hoops , i should probably eat things with lower calories like celery which has no calories and you burn off half a calorie from digesting it . 
0.771 -- to hell with counting carbs , on this diet you eat nothing and drink koolaid with a good dose of tussin every hours . 
0.771 -- the have nearly a protein fat only diet , they re perfectly healthy ... so why do you need lots of carbs ? 
0.771 -- oh , and starting a self imposed calorie diet a the week of pms and b while you are taking access bars , is probably not a good idea .

0.770 -- you may know about the calorie big mac , but how about the calorie cup of coffee and calorie muffin ? 
0.770 -- so they regulate every calorie and carbohydrate to the point that it becomes a lifestyle in and of itself . 
0.770 -- kathy is back on low carb for lent , or more properly i suppose the glycemic index diet , since she has made a distinction between good carbs consume in limited amounts and bad carbs do not consume , so she picked out a hunka hunka tasty meatloaf . 
0.770 -- we ve changed our diet and are eating more salads and not eating out all the time and eating more healthy stuff now like salads and whole wheat bread and watching the sodium intake , since that is a big contributor to high blood pressure .

0.770 -- however , i d like to find a recipe whose individual servings are not more than calories . 
0.770 -- the danger is that this diet can easily transition into the have sex all the time and eat whatever your boyfriend s eating diet , which is less of a diet and more of an advanced accelerated weight gaining system which i know about as as the have sex all the time and don t bother eating diet .

0.769 -- i knew the dinner choice was bad ... better would have been a hotdog and diet soda or water more protein , less carb in the hotdog and of course no sugar in the diet soda water . 
0.769 -- knocking two sodas a day out of my diet accounts for more than unnecessary calories , but had it really caused this drastic a change ? 
0.769 -- it should actually be fewer calories since , y know , you can count the number of calories .

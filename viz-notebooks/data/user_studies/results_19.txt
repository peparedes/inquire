0.734 -- i have started eating differently , in smaller portions , and keeping a log of what i ate and the calories , fat grams , carbs , etc . 
0.734 -- one plus of the poverty diet is i have lost some much needed weight . 
0.734 -- i suspect the slightly low is more due to the fact that i m on higher calories than normal , which makes a much harder target to hit than if i was on a normal calorie diet in fact , of a calorie diet would be g of carbs , so i m more than above that level in terms of carbs for the last week . 
0.734 -- i weigh pounds now and at it puts me at an anorexic classification of weight , i meet another criteria for anorexia ... loss of consecutive periods an counting ... plus i have all the food issues , excessive exercising where i burn about calories even though i barely eat a day .

0.734 -- i try to workout to burn more calories so i am more in the negative calorie range for the day ... because i know using diet software like fitday you buy or how many baseline cals i burn in a day .

0.733 -- as the doctor put it calories out must exceed calories in to lose weight . 
0.733 -- both the weight watchers and the zone dieters lost about percent the ornish diet is the low fat vegetarian diet . 
0.733 -- now that has awesome effects with regard to losing weight ... but so does the limiting your calories which you automatically do more often than not on a low carb diet . 
0.733 -- in fact , a recent review of research studies on high protein , low carbohydrate weight loss diets concluded that weight loss was associated with longer diet duration and restriction of calories , but not with reduced carbohydrate intake . 
0.733 -- i ve decided to also start calorie counting which is more just checking how many calories something is before i eat it . 
0.733 -- after posting the other day about dieting and such , i realized i ve never sat down and kept hard track of the percentages of carbs , protein , and fat i ve been eating . 
0.733 -- one thing about losing weight ... i ve been losing weight by the way . 
0.733 -- i got these requirements from reading about other diets and methods of weight loss . 
0.733 -- i would start off with something nutritional and low calorie , and then completely lose contol . 
0.733 -- i m not counting every single calorie i eat , but i have cut back significantly in the processed foods refined sugars category . 
0.733 -- some nutritional information from these bags : serving size : pieces they re pretty long pieces , about servings per bag : about so i ve got servings sitting on my desk right now total carbohydrates per serving : g of recommended daily value total saturated fat : g calories per serving : calories per twizzler : calories per bite : assuming bites total calories in bags : calories of all the snacks sitting on my desk : number of days i could go without eating if i ate all of these at once : how sick i would feel if i did that : very , very sick 
0.733 -- so far in may (8 days including through tonight s dinner menu , i am averaging , calories daily g fat fat calories or of total , mg sodium that means that , except for the fat calories as percent of total , i am still trending downward , and as long as the fat calorie percentages stays at or below , for now i m happy with that . 
0.733 -- so i just calculated it and thats calories burned , minus the max i plan to eat leaves me with a calorie deficit not counting my rmr which is that should leave me with calories total burned today . 
0.733 -- i geniunely believe that in order to maintain weight loss and get in shape , one must eat a balanced diet , cut calories and exercise , exercise , exercise . 
0.733 -- anyways , on the back of the box it s talking about nutrition facts and such , and it says that or less of your calories should be from fat , which translates into grams of fat in a calorie diet . 
0.733 -- i ve done weight watchers before , and the program was counting points of food based on fiber and caloric and fat content ... along with lots of veggies and fruits and the dreaded measuring and recording of food ... something that i am not fond of . 
0.733 -- i am becoming more determined about my diet , actually counting calories by keeping a spread sheet . 
0.733 -- in my little weight and calorie reports , i definitely should had hours of sleep . 
0.733 -- this week i finally got with the program and started counting the carbs i was taking in rather than guessing and have been averaging about grams of carbs a day , atkins recommends , but then i ve been resistant to weight loss . 
0.733 -- i m fricken tired of fighting weight , counting calories , trying to drink tons of water when i hate water , spending hours devoted to exercise . 
0.733 -- you know ive been thinking is it wrong to feel and guilty after eatting and constant dieting and counting calories and constantly ubsessed with excerise and weight ? 
0.733 -- if i m going to cheat anyway , the lower my caloric intake is when i start , the more in line with acceptable calorie consumption my diet cheating would be . 
0.733 -- break down : calories : noting that for every meal , i ate something tasty and fatty until i was satisfied , and still came out below the recommended diet stat of cal protein g fat : g carbs : g fiber : g net carbs carbs fiber : perfect , considering i shoot for g in the transitional phase i also made it over the usrda for all vitamins reported on in . 
0.733 -- so on july , i officially started striving towards my body s correct allowable calorie intake of calories . 
0.733 -- so like these days i m all like working out and shit and maintaining like a bodybuilder s diet of high protein and low calorie and carbohydrate . 
0.733 -- last week s weight this week s weight weight loss total weight lost so far i actually squealed at the scale , i admit it . 
0.733 -- jumps around tomarrow im starting my diet ... my calorie intake has been moved down to walking atleast miles every day ... followed by ab crunches , lunges , and weight lifting . 
0.733 -- went to the gym today and got weighed and measured : lost inches all around lost lbs in weight lost lbs in body fat so , basically since i started , i have lost almost lbs in both weight and body fat ! 
0.733 -- any time my calorie intake goes above i only lose lb and that blows . 
0.732 -- he also told me that if i want to lose weight i would have to go on a calorie a day diet . 
0.732 -- i could use losing weight by not spending practically all my money on eating . 
0.732 -- each pound is calories so i haev to burn calories a day to lose pounds by august so thats not to bad . 
0.732 -- so i did the math and i walk about calories off a day ... so in order for me to lose weight i have to eat less than calories a day . 
0.732 -- i avoid spagetti and fattening food but barely any weight loss , although i am still getting on the treadmill as much as i can , so maybe its muscle gain thats counter acting the weight loss ? 
0.732 -- when you train , you need to keep a higher calorie diet , which i have been finding difficult , considering my loss of appetite over the past couple of months (8 calories day . 
0.732 -- i ve also upped my calories a bit and added in peanuts for a snack with raisins because i don t like them plain to try and make my calories from carbs vs calories from fat and protein ratio and bit better i had been at about carbs , but i now down to under . 
0.732 -- last week s weight this week s weight weight loss total weight lost so far and strangely enough , i m okay with that . 
0.732 -- i only burned calories doing cardio after pilates today , and then i go and eat calories worth of pocky , most of which was fat . 
0.732 -- it also tells how many calories i need to burn doing cardio to lose the weight i want to lose . 
0.732 -- i am still doing weight watchers , but adding what i need to my diet to keep up with the calories burned and required . 
0.732 -- rda resting energy expenditure from body weight females yo x weight kg x my current weight at lbs calories for resing energy use general estimate wag for heavy labor : calories day person variety in food tends to keep deficiencies in check . 
0.732 -- at least they ve stopped saying you should match weight for weight with vegetables and complex carbs . 
0.732 -- none of this starve myself , low carb , no carb , no fat , meals a day , picky eating , throw up my food , diet pills , i m so fat when i m a size crap . 
0.732 -- in a given week i will consume a ludicrous number of calories in the form of drinks ... cut those out and drop weight , right ? 
0.732 -- so , just counting calories and watching what i eat , and not thinking about weight . 
0.732 -- not even diet pepsi ... it s got cals , fat , and g of carbs ... will this make me gain ? 
0.732 -- diet calories : , calories from fat : total fat : g total carbs : g fiber : g protein : g calories from fat okay , so i did better on most things . 
0.732 -- last week s weight this week s weight weight loss total weight lost so far i m actually under lbs . 
0.732 -- i ve released the constant harassment of self enough to actually lose some weight instead of thinking i m disgusting and have not lost nearly enough weight , thereby binging . 
0.732 -- thus , a calorie a day diet and minutes of cardio , x a week which is recommended for the overweight to lose weight , will do virtually nothing for someone with a genetic inclination towards being overweight , but will do wonders for the new mom that needs to lose some baby weight . 
0.732 -- i have said for over a year that i was going to start a diet , exercise and lose tons of weight . 
0.732 -- i was under my calorie intake for the day less than :-( i noticed that i actually gained a little weight because of this . 
0.732 -- it s basically talking about how she lost weight before her wedding by doing a low carb diet . 
0.732 -- m and i have consumed : energy drinks calories each bag of chips calories package of mini donuts calories and one apple calories unknown total calories for december st i m allotting for lunch my procrastination has led me to stay up all night while feverishly typing three papers and eating like a pig . 
0.732 -- i have until august th , to lose the most weight we are measuring by weight percentage lost . 
0.732 -- however i am now eating loads more sugar and carbohydrates to balance out the loss of fat . 
0.732 -- for the first time since i started dieting or at least low er carb dieting , i am hungry . 
0.732 -- maybe i will lose some weight by walking more ... a great weight loss plan . 
0.732 -- so because of this diet i have had to replace my cola habit , i found kool aid , no calories or sodium . 
0.732 -- i looked online at the fat and calorie contents thingy , and those things have tons of fat in them . 
0.732 -- weight fat ... lost all the baby weight but i feel flabby and just yuck . 
0.732 -- to gain weight , you must eat more calories then your active caloric rate . 
0.732 -- last week s weight this week s weight weight gain total weight lost so far and i m surprisingly okay with that . 
0.732 -- hilights ... i m getting fat , or more so gaining weight , blahhhh . 
0.732 -- i think maybe the reason i m not losing much weight is because of my uber low calorie intake . 
0.731 -- i have already lost some weight , but i need to lose more , and watch my caloric intake ... ive been eating a lot of crap lately . 
0.731 -- well , i officially started my diet yesturday and have already lost like pounds in water weight . 
0.731 -- protein : grams calories carbs : grams calories fat : grams calories total caloric intake calories i ve been keeping the total calories at around so far , and not eating for at least hours before i go to sleep . 
0.731 -- i have kept changing the date for the diet to end and the target weight , each time i lose a little more weight i want to lose more . 
0.731 -- they are actually right about that ... it sux cause i can eat really high carb and fatty foods and not gain any weight and maybe even lose weight . 
0.731 -- i lost ... well not weight , but some of the fat i had , im now pounds ... of lean mean muscles . 
0.731 -- everett : cardio vascular excersice is better for losing fat everett : so that means shit like running everett : take in less calories than you expend everett : pound of fat is equal to calories everett : so if you intake calories a day and expend , then in week you will lose pound of fat everett : i would say drop it down to like to plus excersice everett : actually , calories from fat and calories are the same calories everett : yeah , beer is really bad . 
0.731 -- so after not losing weight for a month or two i became frustrated last week and stopped counting calories . 
0.731 -- food exercise sec post weight , so i have lost three pounds this week . 
0.731 -- when i started losing weight , i decided the logical way to do it would be to find the approximate amount of calories i needed to maintain at my goal weight and then cut my calories down to that level . 
0.731 -- losing weight : i m eating in moderation instead of crazily , and i ve lost or lbs . 
0.731 -- my plan was to do atkins for a kick start , then carry on with a low calorie diet , cutting out fatty carb foods , but not all carbs . 
0.731 -- those on the lower cal , low carb regimen took off pounds , while people who got the same calories on the lowfat approach lost pounds . 
0.731 -- : no wonder i haven t lost weight with all those calories on a daily basis . 
0.731 -- i ve tried slimming world classes , online slimming clubs , calorie counting , exercising madly , pretty much everything . 
0.731 -- nevermind cals per day , should suffice with a calorie burning cardio workout , to lose a pound or more a day . 
0.731 -- i also found out the amount of calories a day that i need to be able to loose weight and keep breastfeeding . 
0.731 -- so far the dieting thing has failed , i havn t lost any weight though jef lost pounds &gt; . 
0.731 -- so according to this website i need calories a day to maintain my weight . 
0.731 -- decrease calorie intake by calories per day and exercising to expend use up the other calories . 
0.731 -- at least i m eating around calories everyday , but that s not enough for me to gain the weight i m supposed to . 
0.731 -- yesterday total calories burned : exercise low but not an aerobic day or weights just rom and light yoga yesterday calorie intake : net calories for the day : once again should be loosing weight not holding and feeling yucky ... weekly total calories burned : (8 from exercise this will build as a percentage of burn i build back from the illness weekly total calorie intake : net calories for the week : remember for each pound loss this will be about , so not major difference but we suspect i ve been running like this for some time and gaining which is why the close monitoring and blood work to adjust meds yes it s all a game of numbers now ... so today i feel the damp weather in my shoulder joints and a bit in my neck . 
0.731 -- i don t care about my weight exactly , since muscle weighs more than fat and i expect to gain weight using my work out . 
0.731 -- im looking to reduce my total calorie intake by about then i ll cardio by about hours a day . 
0.731 -- and even at that , my estimated calorie intake was lower than what s needed supposely to maintain my weight . 
0.731 -- i could have burned million calories in aerobic exercise , the equivalent of half a metric ton of body fat . 
0.731 -- i ate a whole lot less calories yesterday and lost lbs ... which is a strong sign for most of my weight gain being water . 
0.731 -- to calculate your recommended calorie intake , use this formula : your weight in pounds x if you are sedentary , moderately active , very active kcal by the way , kg pounds . 
0.731 -- i ve been eating in basically a low carb lifestyle although never quite making the carb or calorie reduction to see results for many years now . 
0.731 -- need to gain weight ... i weighed lbs in highschool _ aparently being on the pill doesnt make me gain weight heh . 
0.731 -- at weight watchers i got the little key chain for losing ten percent of my original weight , and now i ll have to name my actual weight loss goal . 
0.731 -- so this week i have started a weight loss plan , counting calories , increasing water intake and overall just paying attention to what i am doing . 
0.731 -- water calories diet pepsi calories i ve already had calories today , but most of that will go into the energy i need for work tonight , then studying ! 
0.731 -- like i mentioned , i was able to lose weight in the past without dieting . 
0.731 -- and i havent lost any weight from not eating meat , and i havent gained any weight . 
0.731 -- once we have the house and providing i have lost enough weight i am currently on a weight loss journey that involves loosing a substantial amount of weight we are planning to ttc . 
0.731 -- okay so right now im listening to rolling stones vodo lounge , and i have had of those chipsahoy calorie packs which is like calories ! 
0.731 -- i started taking some diet pills , to see if i cant lose weight . 
0.731 -- it s a good thing , the calorie count on even the small meal i got was calories . 
0.731 -- i did it by eating low fat foods and exercising the anorexia and bulimia came later driven by my fear of gaining weight . 
0.731 -- when i used to eat calories a day i d lose weight super quick super being an but now that i m being healthy i can expect a healthy lbs a week . 
0.731 -- everyone knows that if you lower your calorie intake and burn calories , you are going to lose weight . 
0.731 -- i should be able to maintain my weight by eating around calories a day once i m down to my goal . 
0.731 -- burned by excersise rmr , net cals net cals : pound of fat , calories i m pretty happy with what i did today , i shall up my calorie intake tommorow a little bit , just to avoid starvation mode . 
0.731 -- :-) which actually meant that i lost lbs of real weight , lost pounds of body fat , and gained lbs of lean muscle mass ! 
0.730 -- i want to stay at about calories so i can lose pounds and under g of fat . 
0.730 -- i mean , after eating a , calorie diet and working out times a week for a year and gaining pounds , you really start to get frustrated . 
0.730 -- and then i can increase my calories a bit so that i maintain the weight . 
0.730 -- so that means i probably consume closer to calories on a regular day without gaining weight .

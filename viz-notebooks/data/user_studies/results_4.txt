0.825 -- the other night i found him on the next door neighbor s porch trying to make nice with her cat . 
0.825 -- hopefully all will go well and her next door neighbor won t be home . 
0.825 -- then around : guys from next door start banging on my door to inform me and my roommates of open door night . 
0.825 -- then my father is gonna rip out the whole door wall door section between the downstairs bathroom and the door into the garage . 
0.825 -- then we went to see if there really was anyone living in the house next door to me , we found that the back door was left unlocked and we went in . 
0.825 -- when we came back our stupid neighbor had her boy come outside the door and stare at us . 
0.825 -- ok , today has started off to be a really bad day ... the neighbor next door is like a complete nut ... at about : , she came over and pounded at the door to keep our dogs quiet , because they barked a couple of times . 
0.825 -- they walked next door to me to and knocked on their door and then left . 
0.825 -- then when we got home , the neighbor had to help mike bring me into the apartment . 
0.825 -- god someone just thumped on the door and she got up and walked to the door . 
0.825 -- me and steph got really scared cuz we heard her door open , the one from the garage to the house . 
0.825 -- haha someone just drove up my street and ran over the next door neighbors shovel , who does that at am ... it was amuzing . 
0.825 -- but they ve got a neighbor next door that will probably be able to look after the dog . 
0.825 -- so we went back to my house and got ready , then over to the neighbor s house for pictures . 
0.825 -- when the neighbor kids pushed my front door open and stood there looking in . 
0.825 -- fortunately , my next door neighbor here is a furniture mover and he helped us get it in . 
0.825 -- he is going to be picking from the farm my next door neighbor has . 
0.825 -- then went on to explain that her next door neighbor who shares a driveway with them burst into her house early this morning yelling , kim ! 
0.825 -- then the dog from next door came and meghan ran in the house then it came back and she tried to go through the garage door but it was locked so she was hiding behind the trash barrels ? 
0.825 -- rusty , my next door neighbor came over and helped to push dave out . 
0.825 -- so anyway , while at lowes i ran into my other next door neighbor . 
0.824 -- so i , walked out the door , went next door and returned them . 
0.824 -- the one next door neighbor is a retired one so he said it was ok . 
0.824 -- today my next door neighbor kathy got mad at me for asking a question . 
0.824 -- so i hit the garage door opener , ran up the stairs , and the house garage door was locked and it is never locked ! 
0.824 -- ... later that same day ... man : hey i was talking to that new neighbor next door . 
0.824 -- we re all standing there talking and my next door neighbor decided to come over and talk to us . 
0.824 -- put down the phone , run upstairs and knock on the bedroom door and shout to mommy and uncle frank that daddy s car just pulled up outside the house . 
0.824 -- we came to my house after and watched the girl next door ... danielle bought that in westfield . 
0.824 -- upstairs neighbor : well , my boyfriend said he saw someone looking through the mailbox . 
0.824 -- apparently we disturbed the class next door , but the teacher next door was really cool about it . 
0.824 -- the next day the neighbor went back over to the house and found the blonde crying again . 
0.824 -- and then , miraculously , i see a neighbor come in the back door when standing at the front door , you can look down the hallway inside and see the back door . 
0.824 -- then we went to go see girl next door with elisha cuthbert and emile ? 
0.824 -- the downstairs neighbor just happened to be opening his door , so i borrowed the phone . 
0.824 -- earlier , my cat went to the front door and demanded to be let out , gets all excited when i walk over to the door . 
0.824 -- then i woke up , fell back asleep , and dreamed that orlando bloom lived next door to my next door neighbor and they did not get along , though he was perfectly nice . 
0.824 -- and nobody answered so she walked out into the hallway and this guy raymond one of the metally retarded people from the group home next door had came in our house ! 
0.824 -- i had to go to the next door neighbors to lock up for them .

0.824 -- he said something about the neighbors and the sheep next door and the neighbor shooting dogs . 
0.824 -- the guy , just ran past me and jumped over the fence of the pink house next door ! 
0.824 -- once , a man knocked on the back door and joelle could see him through her next door window now that s what neighbors are for , but after i asked him twice for his name , he went away . 
0.824 -- when he could find anymore ants he left and went to the next neighbor s house . 
0.824 -- then she starts talkin about her next door neighbor s sons , and i got up and walked away . 
0.824 -- then last night i ran into my brothers bedroom door it was dark and the door looked open ! 
0.824 -- after that i got home and went right next door cause my neighbors were having a bonfire . 
0.824 -- then once we got home , i was getting something out of the trunk of the car and my mom closed the garage door , so the door to the trunk started coming down on me . 
0.824 -- the crazy old people we bought the house from put in a sectional home next door . 
0.824 -- we ended up getting the girl next door and watchin it at the house . 
0.824 -- i ran into my next door neighbor at the door , who said , isn t this awfully early for you to be up ? 
0.824 -- somebody never came out the back door just in time to see her child hit a golf ball through the neighbor s kitchen window . 
0.824 -- whoa ... some people just knocked on our front door looking for the the violin teacher next door . 
0.824 -- everytime the door opened you could hear us go door , door , door ! 
0.824 -- my next door neighbors , my across the street neighbors , and the guy and me .

0.824 -- we went and looked at the house my uncle is building next door to hers and it was cool . 
0.824 -- anyway yesterday my neighbor the fireman came over and told me the little black kid who lives right next door to me stolle from a ladies purse up the street out of her garage . 
0.824 -- got there and things were cool , then we got invited next door to his neighbors party . 
0.824 -- and my other neighbor noticed that somebody was trying to break in her front door . 
0.824 -- the kitten cried at the door enough to bother our neighbor across the porch from us . 
0.824 -- we called our next door neighbor to come stay with leah who was asleep until uncle greg could come get her . 
0.823 -- he was a people person and a good neighbor , said dionne gordon , who lived next door . 
0.823 -- we heard someone knocking on the door pretty hard , and one of my parents rushed to get the door . 
0.823 -- once i get to my door the smell is gone , and it not the upstairs neighbor . 
0.823 -- thought next door neighbor had a break in so we called the police and checked out the house then they came home and didn t think too much of it . 
0.823 -- we drove to kirstens and we parked in her next door neighbors driveway , and we ran to her house , put it on the driveway in front of the garage , turned on the garage light , and then we saw a car come down the street . 
0.823 -- we went door to door some more and went back to the doors that had not answered . 
0.823 -- i accidently left the garage door open , and also a neighbor called saying there was a strange car and someone walking through houses . 
0.823 -- at around i took a shower , made fun of my next door neighbor for leaving his garage door open all night . 
0.823 -- we stepped outside for a smoke and hear one of the workman building the house next door freakin out . 
0.823 -- and needed to walk next door neighbors dog hence walked home fourth night farm but didnt end up going . 
0.823 -- other than the fact that i might just have to beat the woman downstairs from us and our next door neighbor . 
0.823 -- my aunt said her dad had one door , holding it closed , and sonny had the other , because my grandma panicked and was running from door to door , trying to get out of the house and get the kids into the storm shelter . 
0.823 -- so my dad broke the dog door on the garage door , unlocked the door , and turned off the alarm . 
0.823 -- _ and he wont open the garage door cause he thinks my neighbor is going to come over with a chain saw or something . 
0.823 -- he answered the door and then went back into the house to get do something . 
0.823 -- then next door came over the wall to look at it and he came in the house !

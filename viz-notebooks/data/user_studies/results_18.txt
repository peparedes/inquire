0.855 -- then i lost weight got down to about lbs and they stayed a c . 
0.855 -- i think i might even be starting to lose weight , in that i haven t gained back the little weight i lost over the past six weeks while i was sick ... so essentially i m losing weight now by not putting it back on right away . 
0.855 -- so i was like its tyte 8d ... she kept goin on and on about how much weight i lost ... but i only lost like pounds ? 
0.854 -- so , basically i have gained back almost all of the weight i lost . 
0.854 -- why do i keep losing weight i lost another pounds in the last month ? 
0.854 -- whatever weight i might of lost in the games , i gained it back today because i pigged out ! 
0.854 -- and i think i can keep off any weight i lose since i only gained the weight because of medicine in the first place . 
0.854 -- all the weight i lost on my diet i gained back , and then some . 
0.854 -- plus , i m starting to regain the weight i lost last year and i want to keep it off .

0.852 -- so i m going to shift my focus on losing more weight and toning more muscles , because surprisingly i ve lost lbs and managed to keep it off even after all the weight lifting i ve done . 
0.852 -- ... lmao i thought i gained weight but isntead i lost weight ... most likely it was muscle weight i lost because i haven t been working out the week before and a few weeks before that since i got injured ... but still ... lbs ! 
0.851 -- my weight loss : right now , i have the desire to lose my weight , but i keep slipping up . 
0.851 -- i lost a lot of weight , but i gained most of it back . 
0.851 -- i like it that i ve lost weight am going to try to keep it off lose more . 
0.851 -- so i went to curves today to work out , i got weighed and measured and found out , out of all the weight i lost i gained back ten pounds of it ! 
0.851 -- i have lost lbs total and i have kept it off ... which is good . 
0.851 -- i ve lost pounds since i stared a concerted effort to lose the weight i gained while so sick last year and on all kinds of meds that made me gain weight . 
0.850 -- of i lost fifty pounds on that diet , and i kept it off for two years . 
0.850 -- i ve gained weight since last year all the weight i lost is coming back twice as fast than i lost it . 
0.850 -- in total i have lost pounds since trying to loose weight ... i m not really sure where i lost the weight at though . 
0.850 -- i gave up fast food because i want to lose weight and keep it off . 
0.849 -- i know that most of the lbs i lost was water weight , but that s still weight lost ! 
0.849 -- : weight : i ve recently managed to made it back to the bottom of the normal region of weight for my height , but i have still to regain the weight lost over leprecon . 
0.849 -- and im sad last time i went to the doctors i had lost weight , got down like pounds , gained back , and it sucks . 
0.849 -- i lost a ton of weight , but put it all back on , cause i lost my motivation somewhere . 
0.848 -- but then i stalled in my weight loss , got discouraged , and gradually slacked off on the diet until i was back to eating like my husband does , and had regained all but pounds of what i had lost . 
0.848 -- i was sick for a month straight lost some weight and now im gaining it back . 
0.848 -- turns out that i didnt gain back all the weight i had originally lost . 
0.848 -- last time i said i was going to lose weight , i lost about pounds and then went nuts and regained like of it . 
0.848 -- people kept telling me i would gain all this weight if i quit but the last time i quit i was running and lost weight , same this time , i have lost lbs . 
0.847 -- i lost lbs and i plan on keeping it off , and toning it up . 
0.847 -- i lost weight ... and then i came home and gained it all back ... and more ... yes ! 
0.847 -- i ate too much yesterday and probably gained all the weight i lost back . 
0.847 -- slowly i managed to wake up out of it all and suddenly realised i had lost a lot of weight . 
0.847 -- i lost lbs since they lost saw me and they still picked on my weight . 
0.847 -- first off i finally hit my weight loss last week losing of your starting weight gets you an award in weight watchers and i m still slogging away at it , i still have pounds to lose . 
0.847 -- i stayed at the weight before i left work , when i had lost over pounds . 
0.847 -- i have been retaining like mad , i gained back all the weight i had lost . 
0.847 -- anyways ... i m going to get back to exercising with ddr again because it made me lose weight , when i quit doing it mom thinks i gained some of the weight back so i only ended up losing five pounds according to the dr . 
0.847 -- but i lost all the bakery weight i gained ... if i can just keep it off in a healthy manner . 
0.847 -- it was a good weekend ... i found out i lost some weight at weight watchers . 
0.847 -- back before i lost a bunch of weight and cut off all my hair . 
0.846 -- i figured if i lost the weight i might as well keep it off . 
0.846 -- ive dropped some weight and kept it off and keep going down by exercising and changing my diet . 
0.846 -- and he kept losing and losing and losing and i think his final weight was pounds , when it should have been around , i think . 
0.845 -- i lost so much weight over the summer and i have managed to gain it all back . 
0.845 -- i ve already lost some weight =) my pants keep falling off xd i lost lbs last week when we went to disney ! 
0.845 -- it s been about a year since i was exercising regularly so i m pretty out of shape and have gained back all the weight i lost back then ... i need to lose it again . 
0.845 -- so i lost more weight , and got down another or pounds , i think . 
0.845 -- i mean , i lost some weight , so that takes a load off . 
0.845 -- the funny thing is that before i lost weight i wore a and a half , but now i wear a even my feet lost weight . 
0.845 -- i ate so much ... i proably gained back all of my lost weight ! 
0.845 -- i realized that i lost a lot of weight , or at least maintained my weight with ddr . 
0.845 -- i feel great and am keeping off the weight i lost in the past year . 
0.844 -- i ve lost a good chunk of weight , but right now i m at a standstill , cuz when i lose weight on my diet through the week , i go home , drink lots of beer over the weekend and come back where i left off , rather than losing more weight ... it sucks ! 
0.844 -- about six years back , i lost a considerable amount of weight and have kept it off pretty handily . 
0.844 -- i have started eating a lot to gain back all of the weight that i lost . 
0.844 -- and let me not forget ... my mother kept pointing out how i d gained back all the weight i lost . 
0.844 -- i lost pounds in days and basically kept that off and lost a few more . 
0.844 -- at first , i lost a lot of weight , but when i stopped with the diet and resumed eating normally , i gained a lot of weight , because my metabolism was so screwed up . 
0.843 -- i m working on losing weight but i keep losing and sustaining it , its pissing me off ... like rawr baybay . 
0.843 -- just two more pounds and i have lost everything that i have gained back since i last lost weight . 
0.843 -- i have gained back about pounds of the weight i worked so hard to lose . 
0.843 -- i ve still got six pounds to go to gain back the weight i lost . 
0.843 -- i m gaining back the weight that i lost and that pisses me off . 
0.843 -- she keeps telling me to lose weight ... and i lost over pounds , but i would look alot better if i lost another . 
0.843 -- yeah , i lost weight like i wanted to , and im getting back on my diet to lose more weight for next year . 
0.843 -- with dalila , i bounced back so quick , in fact i lost extra weight . 
0.843 -- more pounds and i ll have recovered all the weight gain i lost on vacation and just after . 
0.843 -- i lost weight while i was away , and everyone noticed , so that was good . 
0.842 -- ok ... well i gained back all the weight i was attempting to lose ... all of it and more . 
0.842 -- i thought that when i lost all the baby weight , i would loose them too , but they stayed , and all the weight left ! 
0.842 -- kept losing weight and spontaneously gaining it by ... um , speed weight loss tactics , so i basically ended up within a pound of my division . 
0.842 -- i did weight watchers when i was about , and i lost weight , but the minute i got off it couldn t afford it , i gained it all back . 
0.842 -- well im back in the time i was gone i cut my hair , got taller , and lost weight . 
0.842 -- i finally managed to lose all that weight i had so much trouble losing . 
0.842 -- i lost a ton of weight in may june because i just got fat but i lost even more weight here ! 
0.842 -- :( i ve put the weight back on that i had lost ... again ! 
0.842 -- i seem to have put on all the weight that i lost before i came down here . 
0.842 -- i think i need a bit of impetus i ve managed to keep off all the weight i lost on it and i can handle a week of pain for a lb loss which i manage to keep off . 
0.842 -- once i started losing weight , i went down a size so it s okay now . 
0.842 -- i keep my measurements in a weight loss paper journal i ve used it since i think ... since the time i lost a ton of weight after moving back to knoxville . 
0.841 -- i lost the weight before my teeth got pulled so i ve probably lost more : 
0.841 -- i lost the most weight when i was sick , and am steadily putting it back on , darnit . 
0.841 -- when i was trying to lose weight i gained and then last night i had a major binge but when i weighed my self this morning i had lost all the weight ... im not complaining because well i lost weight so woooo , but its just really confusing me ! 
0.841 -- i lost all that weight last year , and all i had left was pounds to lose . 
0.841 -- i didn t lose much weight but i did keep off most of what i lost , instead of gaining more . 
0.841 -- i lost a good bit of weight then too , but then i crashed and gained it back . 
0.841 -- ok , so the weight loss ... i ve lost most of my excess weight . 
0.841 -- i m not saying i want to lose weight , because a year is a long time to lose weight and keep it off . 
0.841 -- and to top it off , i m sure i gained back some , if not all , of the weight i lost last summer . 
0.841 -- because anything i start to do to lose weight i have to continue doing forever in order to keep the weight off and actually lose weight . 
0.841 -- lol finally people are saying i lost weight all around instead of always saying my face lost weight . 
0.841 -- thats how i lost pounds the last time i tried to actually lose weight . 
0.841 -- found out i lost some weight , i m pounds under stone now , hopefully i keep going down from now on . 
0.840 -- got a set of diet pills and got it upped by the doc since i gained back all the weight i lost . 
0.840 -- im trying to keep up with my losing of weight but i kinda fell off a bit but im back at it . 
0.840 -- and i even lost weight i lost lbs over the past week but its not enough ... i want to be skinny ! 
0.840 -- i gained back all of the weight that i had lost up since i had started on the program . 
0.840 -- so now before i can loose weight properly i have to eat loads and put all the weight back on that i lost :| . 
0.840 -- i havent lost actual weight but i managed to lose the weight from my binge week weekend so that gave me a boost . 
0.840 -- i lost weight , regained it , lost it again , then lost some more . 
0.840 -- bueno , i have managed to regain all lost weight and am pretty much back to pre peru weight status . 
0.840 -- but despite not really having lost much weight , i ve lost inches off my waist ! 
0.840 -- i thought i had gained weight but come to find out i have lost pounds . 
0.840 -- i ve lost a little more weight and i m hoping to keep it off . 
0.840 -- i gained back most of the weight i d lost , because i stopped exercising as well ... i just stopped everything . 
0.839 -- yeah , so i just got back from weight watchers ... i lost pound . 
0.839 -- i have kinda toned down my weight loss program because i ve lost so much weight pounds in a fairly short period . 
0.839 -- my weight loss slowed down , damnit , oh well i mean im still losing weight . 
0.839 -- then , after a month , i realized i had gained back all of the weight i lost . 
0.839 -- i know starting off will show quick weight loss results and i know that after a while the weight won t drop off as quickly , but i m having fun as i lose weight and gain muscle ! 
0.839 -- i m trying to ease up on my diet , but i still keep losing weight . 
0.839 -- i neeeeeed to lose weight again since i gained back half the lbs i lost last year . 
0.839 -- i ve been trying to lose weight since the end of my freshman year , and i got pounds off , which was cool , but i can t keep it off . 
0.839 -- back to weight watchers to lose the pounds i lost before i got pregnant , plus all the new , fun baby weight . 
0.839 -- it turns out that i have to lose weight because i weight over stone . 
0.839 -- while i was studying for the boards , i lost close to pounds and i haven t been able to regain my lost weight . 
0.839 -- i eventually got back up to and i pretty much stopped the weight gaining exercises . 
0.839 -- but i m super psyched because i kept weight myself today , and every time i had lost more weight ! 
0.839 -- due to no hard work on my part whatsoever , i have lost a bit of weight and am down a total of pounds i d been down but i gained six back . 
0.839 -- i finally lost weight the slow way with diet , in a way i can keep up with and didn t lose when i was off the wagon , even for over a week . 
0.839 -- now , i just gotta maintain the weight i ve lost and hope that the lost weight doesn t find its way back home . 
0.838 -- i started off with regular , but started to lose weight so i switched to diet . 
0.838 -- i lost a little over lbs , but no , my fat ass couldn t keep losing weight . 
0.838 -- well , because of the holidays i fell off the weight lost wagon , but i am not back on it . 
0.838 -- i m going back to the gym to lose all the weight i gained back on since grease . 
0.838 -- more so after i lost a lot of weight , i want to trim down . 
0.838 -- i eventually gave up on weight watchers after not really losing anything but i kept working out . 
0.838 -- it has been a busy day and i have to get back in to working out because i gained back all the weight i lost . 
0.838 -- so i finally gained back all that weight i lost a few months back . 
0.838 -- except that i ve lost so much weight , that my pants started sliding down off of me . 
0.838 -- lose at least the weight i ve put on since i last said i was going to lose weight . 
0.838 -- i have regained the weight i lost in thailand ... back to kgs again , which sucks . 
0.838 -- not only have i lost the gained weight , but now i am down another lbs . 
0.838 -- yesterday i went to weight watchers and weighed in and lost lbs ... i thought i would have gained because i sort of cheated on my diet last week , but i lost weight instead , yay ! 
0.837 -- pretty much all the weight i lost ... i gained back these past days lol . 
0.837 -- weight : pounds left to lose : so somehow , in the middle of everything that s been going on , i have managed to maintain my weight ! 
0.837 -- i am full and gained back all the weight i lost while working out . 
0.837 -- i lost more weight ... i was down to last thursday ... i think i am again ... still ... i lost way too much weight in the last month . 
0.837 -- i ve lost all of that weight that i mysteriously gained and it s still going down . 
0.837 -- i gained back the weight that i lost after the dumping of the idiot . 
0.837 -- i ve gained back all the weight and then some of the weight i lost right before thanksgiving . 
0.837 -- so since i started losing weight , my scrubs are starting to hang off me because i went out and bought a bigger size cos i had gained weight since junior year . 
0.837 -- since my weight gain of last week , i stepped it up in the diet and excersize plan , and i think i lost the weight i gained and then some . 
0.837 -- at the height of my weight loss , i reached about lbs lost ... over christmas i went back home which is always treacherous for my eating habits and routine ... i put back on ... which i expected and figured it was mostly water weight and would be able to get it back off in a week to week and a half . 
0.837 -- i guess i didnt realize since ive lost some weight how loose these pants were and they kept falling down . 
0.837 -- i actually gained back the weight i lost plus a pound and a half . 
0.837 -- i have kept up the dieting and exercise and i have lost about pounds . 
0.837 -- im finally starting to lose a bit of that weight i had gained back . 
0.837 -- i gained all the weight i lost back , maybe even added a few pounds ... all i know is i have to lose it again and its hard work . 
0.837 -- i am down to pounds though , ive lost pounds in like a couple weeks ... i wasnt losing weight in the beginning , it was just like all of a sudden i lost pounds . 
0.836 -- in the past when i have tried to lose weight i just simply forget i am suppose to be losing weight . 
0.836 -- but when i tried to put weight on it , i fell back down . 
0.836 -- i ve lost all that amount of weight , have managed to keep off all that amount of weight , and see no reason why i shouldn t be able to keep this weight off , given my restrained diet and moderate exercise . 
0.836 -- i ve stayed the same weight since i had cameron , after losing all that weight . 
0.836 -- losing weight , i was down to lb lost but then over the last eight weeks with christmas and my birthday and all i lost the diet motivation and i ve regained lb . 
0.836 -- i definitly need to keep working out , that weight i lost needs to stay off . 
0.836 -- i must find a way to put a stop to this weight gaining thing and lose the weight i ve regained . 
0.836 -- but i lost more weight i m down to now and that kicked my ass . 
0.836 -- but i lost all the weight i wanted to lose before this week so thats faboulous ! 
0.836 -- needless to say , i gained back all the weight i had lost this week . 
0.836 -- anyway , i kept piling on the weight on the leg press and i felt all cool , cause i got up to pounds . 
0.836 -- when i dropped out of peabody and moved back to pa i actually lost some weight and was down to ish . 
0.836 -- i kept it for about months and it paid off ... i lost about lbs . 
0.836 -- i already cheated just one day and gained back like all the weight i d lost . 
0.836 -- i litterally gained back all the weight i had lost within months of quitting . 
0.836 -- years passed , i kept that weight off , had another baby , gained about pounds back . 
0.836 -- had a baby , which means weight gain , and luckily i have kept the baby weight off , but i was on the high side when i got pregnant , so now i am back to that higher weight i don t like . 
0.836 -- just when i thought i was gaining weight ... it turns out that i lost another two pounds . 
0.836 -- once i got off of it , the weight started coming back , despite i was still exercising every day . 
0.836 -- i ve lost count of the number of cashews i ve consumed i lost weight , then gained weight , and now i m trying to lose weight again ... before saturday . 
0.836 -- i ate alot of food over christmas and gained some weight , but then i lost it back off again . 
0.836 -- i ve lost a lot of weight before with it , i gained it back , so i start diet . 
0.836 -- sighs the diet worked , i lost like ... pds and such ... but ... then it just stopped working ... and i stayed at that weight for almost a year , then i started gaining weight again . 
0.836 -- i lost like pounds before , but then i went off and gained it back . 
0.836 -- in fact , i think i gained back all the weight i lost the week before ! 
0.836 -- i stopped losing weight , but i have not gained any , which is ok because i started the pregnancy above my ideal weight , anyway . 
0.836 -- i know i lost weight but i just figured it was because i went off the birth control which caused me to gain a few pounds . 
0.836 -- i thought i d lost a bit , but the number jumped back up again today when i weighed in , so it was probably just water weight that i lost before . 
0.835 -- everyone thought that i had lost weight which i have i have lost lbs . 
0.835 -- miraculously , i ve not only kept weight off in spite the broken foot , but actually lost more . 
0.835 -- fyi , i was never really overweight in the first place , lbs , but i ve gained some weight in my stomach and hips that i m looking to lose and keep off . 
0.835 -- also , i gained a fuck load of weight , everything i lost , which was quite a bit , i gained back . 
0.835 -- i am in excellent health and have managed to keep most of the weight i lost on the zone off !

0.831 -- so not only did i put back on the weight i lost last autumn , but i gained some . 
0.831 -- i lost a lot of weight last year , but then kinda fell off the wagon . 
0.830 -- gotta lose weight ... when i found out i lost pounds , i went on an eating spree !

0.830 -- if only i could have kept off the weight i lost on any of the diets i ve been on in my life . 
0.830 -- i am not trying to lose weight , but just put a control to my weight more because for the past mths , i was putting weight on too fast .

0.830 -- dude i finnaly lost some weight ... i m actually back on the right track to getting down a size . 
0.830 -- i ve gained weight by moving here already and i need to get that back off and return to the weight loss plan . 
0.830 -- i don t really think i need to lose weight so much as just tone up and eat sensibly to keep my weight steady , especially since i lost lbs in about days last week . 
0.829 -- yeah i lost weight , and am down to lbs , but apparently it was all boob weight . 
0.829 -- i just got on the scales and apparently i have actually lost weight over christmas . 
0.829 -- ive lost weight while here mostly by default because the food sucks and i barely eat anything , not that im complaining cuz well lost weight is lost weight no matter how you lose it . 
0.829 -- a good thing that happened today was someone said that i looked like i lost weight and at the dr i found out i had lost weight ! 
0.829 -- i gained a lil weight back , but i m trying to lose it again . 
0.829 -- i found out that whispers i have lost weight and gone down a shirt size . 
0.829 -- so i thought i had lost even more weight and i went for a checkup , but was relieved to hear that i still maintained my weight but need to put on more . 
0.829 -- so yeah this morning i went and took all the weight loss crap off of here and transfered it to my weight loss journal . 
0.829 -- going back to my weight , i know why i ve done it lost weight . 
0.829 -- also when i lose some of this damn weight i gained seriously , i gained a shitload of weight and am back to the weight i was a year ago ... appalling ! 
0.829 -- i even managed to lose all the weight i had gained due to the depression so that was nice . 
0.829 -- umm ... i went to wendys than added on all the weight that i lost . 
0.829 -- cuz i lost a bunch of weight then gained it back , so probably the same iii . 
0.829 -- im starting to gain back all the weight i worked so hard to lose . 
0.829 -- i checked my weight there and it seems as though i have lost lots of weight . 
0.829 -- on a separate note , i have been losing weight like crazy ... i am now down to the goal weight , but i will have to keep it off that is the problem . 
0.829 -- emotionally , physically ... i ve gained back most of the weight i lost last summer ... well , i lost lbs ... i have gained back of it . 
0.829 -- jeez ... i lost a lot of weight though , but i m not down to the weight size that i want . 
0.829 -- i m up about lbs , but i m not going to record a weight until i have a loss , even if it s still above my last recorded weight , i ll know i have lost some of the gained weight . 
0.829 -- somehow i lost lbs and i am now back down to i had only gained lbs so far so now losing it back off isn t that good . 
0.829 -- i had weight loss surgery and lost a lot of weight but i need to stay in shape too . 
0.829 -- i m really struggling at the moment because i m losing weight due to stress well its what my doctor said cause i ve dropped like one and a half stone and its the first time i ve ever lost weight without meaning to so my weight is going up and down and its really hard to take . 
0.828 -- i have still lost over pounds and close to my goal of weight loss . 
0.828 -- i also kept the weight off alot longer ; it wasn t until i started living on fast food and stopped walking that i gained it back . 
0.828 -- i lost pounds due to not eating =( well i guess losing the weight is a good thing , but once i start to get my taste back im gonna gain weight easily .

0.828 -- i had lost weight and they started to creep down my hips while i was standing .

0.828 -- i was so angry that i threw them both off my back , a combined weight of over lbs . 
0.828 -- i weighed myself on one of those weight lucky number machines , and maybe it s just wrong , i mean , it was a weight machine in a mall but it said i d only gained one pound back since i had gotten sick and lost all that weight . 
0.828 -- i have gained back all the weight and more probably that i lost over the summer . 
0.828 -- my weight loss has dropped off dramatically since i stopped going to the gym . 
0.828 -- anyway , um ... i may have lost weight , but i keep forgetting to weigh myself in the morning . 
0.828 -- goal weight : current weight : starting weight : pounds lost : pounds left to lose : well , if you dont hear from me anytime soon , it s because i hit it big and i forgot the little people .

0.828 -- i lost weight when i fell sick before and now i ve regained them . 
0.828 -- i have kept the majority of the weight off , but i never got back to my lowest pre baby weight of only lbs from where i am now ... not a big deal really . 
0.828 -- i go on diets to lose weight , it goes well for a while , but then i quit and gain the weight back . 
0.828 -- , , , ... the weight kept coming off and i wasn t even exercising . 
0.828 -- when i lost pounds about years ago , i managed to keep it off , although with the advent of all the hormonal issues , i have gained weight again .

0.827 -- down to lbs now and for some reason i feel like i gained weight rather than lost it . 
0.827 -- i kept losing my nose ring while i was sleeping and it hurt evertime i kept losing it so of course i would wake up it . 
0.827 -- i gained weight , lost weight ... lost a lot of weight , then gained it all back and packed on a few more pounds . 
0.827 -- i m planning to start weight lifting again since i lost a lot of weight . 
0.827 -- now , i ve lost over lbs , but i still left to go to get down to my pre pregnancy weight . 
0.827 -- i figured ... in the long run , the weight i lose won t stay off . 
0.827 -- i also started doing la weight loss and i have lost lbs in weeks . 
0.827 -- i lost weight when i first got home , but what s really annoying is that i started gaining that weight back when i started going to the gym regularly .

0.827 -- the short form i have gained back much of my former lost weight i m at lbs .

0.827 -- really , i gained lbs , lost , then regaining and this time i want to keep it off and just lose at least lbs and i think i ll be really satsified with my body . 
0.827 -- i really thought i would gain back the weight i had lost with my hard work , but to my surprise today i had lost three pounds . 
0.827 -- today should mark the start of me getting back on my diet and trying to start losing weight again , i have managed to keep most of what i lost off , but i haven t lost anymore since all this drama in my life started hitting the fan . 
0.827 -- again , i have done what i thought was impossible , lost more weight through weight watchers . 
0.827 -- i went to the gym last night with jesse and found i gained back all the weight i lost except like four pounds .

0.827 -- i also lost lbs in days just so i could make my weight again .

0.823 -- i kept that weight off for another year and then slowly it starting creeping back on , i would diet and get back down , but as the years went on , the weight went on faster and if i did not keep a daily weight check on my weight , it got to the point where is was noticable when the smaller size clothes were to tight agaian ... so back to the diet and excerising walk daily and fighting the weight to near down by to lbs .

0.781 -- i could work on losing weight and my abs ... and i could get more flexible . 
0.781 -- when i lose weight , i wont lose my boob weight because big boobs run way back on both sides of my family . 
0.781 -- i need to get my body moving ; oh and of course lose weight . 
0.781 -- i figure since i ve maintained weight at my current shitty lifestyle , these simple changes might help me start dropping pounds . 
0.781 -- maybe if i weighed myself everyday i would be more conscious of my weight and i would eat less , exercise more and lose weight faster . 
0.781 -- and my shrinks uping my losing weight its really a mood stabilizer medicine , so i should be losing more weight faster . 
0.781 -- honestly , i m happy because i lost weight but so over this whole diet weight thing .

0.780 -- i m not dieting or trying to lose weight , i m lbs which is a feat considering my sedentary lifestyle . 
0.780 -- i feel fat but i worry that if i lose weight my dress will fit even less .

0.780 -- i didn t lose my weight i gained a lb ... least we all know it s muscle weight . 
0.780 -- i made a deal with my mom ... if i lose weight and get down to my goal weight , she ll buy me breasts .

0.780 -- i want to lose weight so i can fit into all my clothes again . 
0.780 -- i m not trying to make any changes in my weight , but i think my point in being aware of my nutrition and my weight is so that i don t get to a point where i am attempting to lose weight . 
0.780 -- i figure , i ll add in the exercise , and if that s not enough to start losing the weight i want to lose i ve watched my weight steadily climb from lbs a year and a half ago , to lbs three nights ago i ll start making lifestyle changes to my eating habits . 
0.780 -- i eat good and make an effort with my diet and i gain weight . 
0.780 -- i started as a girl who simply wanted to lose weight ... but i turned losing weight into my life .

0.664 -- yusef is dieting and peter and nanney went on the diet to support him . 
0.664 -- i am all for lifestyle change over diet , but a lifestyle change this drastic leaves me feeling like i m on a super strict diet , and weeks into it i m still fighting .

0.663 -- it s a no low carb diet suggested by one of my shift managers , so i am eating unlike my old starvation crash diets . 
0.663 -- if i am going to diet , i need to loose ... or i need to eat like a regular person , but not diet and gain .

0.663 -- so i am going to start a healthy diet and monitor what i eat and take my multi vitamins and such and return to the gym . 
0.663 -- i eat a lot of pasta and carbohydrates so if i go on a low carb diet and exercise then i should be able to lose the weight .

0.662 -- i ve also noticed that diet pepsi doesn t set my urinary tract on fire like diet coke does . 
0.662 -- i figure , if i m going to be breaking my diet anyways , i can read my dieting book ... as one may know , drinking causes a person to become more thirsty ... eating sugary foods , the same ... drambuie is a honey d ? 
0.662 -- &gt; i did my three day personal dietary analysis thing for nutrition class , and i m pretty much deficient in everything except for sodium and fat , but i didn t need a usda dietary analysis to tell me that . 
0.662 -- not really , but i m going to go on a diet ... where i eat healthy and exercise . 
0.662 -- although , i do agree that creatine helps people as a dietary supplement to those on a lacto ovo vegetarian diet to get the nutrients found only in meat and fish . 
0.662 -- diets suck ... men are confusing ... i love pizza ... i ve almost completely faild my diet ... again . 
0.661 -- though i am beginning to warm up to pepsi ... i cannot stand diet coke , tho i will drink diet pepsi ... macdonalds or burger king : mcdonalds ! 
0.661 -- one more thing i ve had some people comment on my diet , i apprciate that alot , but i worded it wrong ... fad diets dont work , this isnt a slim fast diet or unhealthy something or other where i starve myself ... its a personal challenge of exercise and healthy eating . 
0.661 -- um , decided to go on a diet , well not a diet , i guess you could call it a routine , im going to eat healthy .

0.661 -- i have no reason to diet , or change my eating style , but i am . 
0.661 -- i m still eating my calorie diet and i ve been exercising and ... nothing . 
0.661 -- so next week : i am in a stricter diet and i should follow it impeccably . 
0.661 -- i m hoping my current insane diet will help with that , because if i have to make even more diet changes ... ugh . 
0.661 -- in november and december , i plan to do two weeks of the no carb diet , one week of the cabbage soup diet , and one week of any random diet . 
0.661 -- it s not a new diet , but moreso a new diet to me .

0.661 -- diet drinks are the best i m all about being vegetarian i refuse to eat at mcdonalds total : i check my myspace everyday . 
0.661 -- apparently my mom and amy are going on a diet and because my mom is dieting the whole family is going on a diet , me included ... i dont need no diet ! 
0.661 -- it s not the actual diet ; it s the pre diet to reset your body so that you can follow the normal diet better . 
0.661 -- i m too fat and therefore i ve decided to go on a diet . 
0.661 -- i also followed the veggie diet while we were there since jill s a vegetarian . 
0.661 -- of course the paleo diet will work for some people , people who are on a mild to moderate exercise regime and don t mind eating fish bones . 
0.661 -- so i m trying this new diet , it s called : the i don t have money for food diet . 
0.661 -- =) so i m not on so much as a diet , as i changed my lifestyle eating habits . 
0.661 -- update on the diet as long as i m not reminded of carbs , i do okay . 
0.661 -- i m not trying to diet , just to be more aware of my intake . 
0.661 -- so therefore , people on diets like the atkins diet would naturally go for that one . 
0.661 -- animal testing : no disney movies : yeah ... i love most of them ... diet soda : i luv diet coke w . 
0.661 -- so im on this wierd diet thing , its called the south beach diet , which is kinda like a healthier way of eating , i dont think im fat !

0.660 -- i m on a strict diet of werner herzog , which is probably why i m so grumpy .

0.660 -- i m drinking this crappy diet sprite right now , but i ate some garfield spaghetti o s earlier read ?

# INQUIRE PROJECT

MEETING WITH SPOTIFY DESIGNER
==============================

remove the loading.. at the bottom of search Results
Different datasets have different structures
 emotion encoded by user - not machine learning - clicks on link, had to find
 search for music again, got an artist name and got excited

Livejournal has current music, could be extracted for metadata
Check more


Designers - goal is to build personas

Music is my life - similarity comes after others despite query

Filled bar to show similarity - or percentage - or something else to show similarity metric that's intuitive

Using self knowledge to explain what people write about in lifejournal, music prefs

snip the result and save it in history

Can spend 15 minutes or more in even just one profile

Jump in and parse through instead of looking at a spreadsheet


How about working with the spreadsheet alone?

Give other options to fill in, e.g suggestions to run as query.

What do filter words do? Eliminate sentences that have that word -

Fix the filter : apply before or after]]]

Remove key word from search?

Wants to tag a sentences- aka save it

highlight Interesting results, and run a query on all at once

Order by users, similarity, alphabetically for results,  etc.

Repetitive sentences Interesting

On results list, have option for 'query this!'

Have some indication that the system is working

Filter by emotion

Cluster emotions? - filter maybe

Save ideas, to use in research or Design

Can go back, and be lead to do more queries, Not just ten minutes then leave

For every session - save

Graph
======

separate node?

path-similarity

Not getting much from this

focuses on queries, says graph not a great tool for this type of research

more
====

The further I go linearly down, doesn't feel efficient.
Show more than having just a list,

Starting to feel magnitude as one sees more and more

thinks about how much time they're gonna have to look at all this.
(maybe share with other people)

Huge amount of information

Strategy, how could I go through all this material?

Dynamic filters?

Want to see the set shrink and shrink, just to see if I'm making progress

Sharing progress with other users

Deleting some results, clearing some then automatically

Tinder like swiping, remove, I want this gone

stepping down Dynamic

For things to be deleted, show similar things to be deleted,

This is a waaaaay bigger scale - guidance would be helpful

Guiding people in the workflow is important,

Could I say run this workflow? - Interesting

choose model, lstm etc.

filling in the blank done well

white grey table, align the text and numbers, make text bolder or bigger

self suggesting filters


order by different parameters, just like the google table

use major queries once, didn't use query much, use the results one by one, and

Designers - Want to learn the personas, understand the users

Have a way to manage the results by users



Commuterweb Actions
====================

https://www.distelli.com/docs/tutorials/build-and-deploy-meteor-with-nginx/

I did this command

sudo sed -i -e 's/us.archive.ubuntu.com/archive.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
and then I could do sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get install curl

which successfully installed curl.

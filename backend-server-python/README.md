# SERVER

Use `python start_server.py` to start the server from this directory.

It will serve static files from the `static` folder, `/` will redirect to `index.html`.

The API for now supports epsilon clustering for the graph (which is hosted). We still need to add actual results data on the JS side!

By default, the server is available at `localhost:8080`.

##DOCUMENTATION

This is the most recent front-end to the Inquire Project. It's built using MeteorJS, ReactJS and MongoDB. The queries are directed at the backend server for search results, and can be cached as users dictate.

For users, the initial search page doesn't cache any results, if a user needs to keep a record of any progress, they need to create a session which will store a record of their search queries, the results and edits, notes and insights gained, interesting users and any other information they need. Our goal is to be able to generate a report for the research sessions created whenever required.
